                                Lecture - 12
                  Systems analysis and design (TIME 01:17)

last time we were looking at the development of s r s namely system
requirement specifications and various parts of the systems requirement
specification which include the data flow diagrams as well as document flow
diagrams and we explained how these things are derived
now that is not the end of the development of s r s because as i point out
at very beginning the uh process of getting at the requirements is not uh
linear process its an heteratic process towards you have to turn back and
refine system requirement specification based on some further inputs uh
particularly the method we are going to use to meet the system requirement
which have been given by the management
so to very quickly review i have put up this picture here
uh you start with the study start with the study of a current system

current system or if it is a existing current system and then start abolish
here with the specifications of  system given by the user
again you design the logical system what we have been trying to do
and you get a new system model
and user stated requirement which are used in the design and working new
system model
but then what happens this at this stage you are not complete the hole
thing
because you really have to look at weather the system which you have
proposed is feasible
i will explain what is meant by feasibility that is going to major part of
this lecture and we had modified this system model and get the new system
requirement specifications which are feasible and which satisfies the
requirement of the organization
so you have to end with coming up with new d f ds and new processing rules
and also described statement of what information will  provide
particularly operational practical  tactical and strategy and
they is a set of data items require to be able to meet the requirements
so this is what you finally end up with
so the s r s document will

consist of document flow diagram as many as needed depending upon the
company
i give you one sample but in a larger case there will be many many sample
which will be require infact i would urge you to read the chapter four
chapter four and look analysis and design of system has a detailed case
study where number different flow diagram are given for um particular
example or case study of developing a hostel information system
and we also some details about what i have given the favor in terms of the
books and organization receiving goods and sending for inspection and
finding out discrepancy between what you have ordered and what was
delivered and that part only part of it because its a lot of chain after
that
a chain after that inspection will inspect the items and that stage also
the may reject some items and accept some items
what ever is accepted they will send document to the stores saying that
this items have been accepted will come to the store and for physically
they send items to the store along with the document saying what items are
going to come to the store and as soon as things are receiving the store
the store has to intimate accounts
saying that these items have been taken into stock and so payment is due to
the end
so they will send document saying that this vendor has against this order
given this many items which have been accepted and found satisfactory you
can go ahead and pay
and accounts officer has to create a proper kind of a sacred case invoice
to the vendor
and the prices so on which earlier on negotiated based on the order which
is placed
and create a check nowadays checks are also either printed in the computer
and check sent physically by mail or courier what have you or
nowadays also have a method of debiting the bank account directly and
creating the bank account  of the customer which all need paper moving from
the company to the vendor
depends upon kind of agreement to vendor and so on
plus nowadays banks prefer with using so called electronic leading service
where you directly send or debit note to your account and create note to
the vendors account and it is automatically done
so these are all successive stages in a entire development so for look at
the hole pictures
the hole picture you can farley large in complex
and later on we will probably look at one such case with a data flow
diagram and giving the processes which are being done in that
i rarely gave favors at this time but the details worked out later which we
will do
now the s r s document consists of the document flow diagram as i said as
many as needed and data flow diagrams also there will be large set of
processes and large set of data flows and so on
      and it is fairly large so there is need to kind of split that part
between the  number of parts these parts have looked at some care
infact real systems runs into hundreds of thousands of  lines of code in a
in a company
so the small which we are going to discuss only give you a idea how these
thing are done
of course not a single person will not hundreds of thousands of  lines of
code so on
in split between number of people in a teams
so we had to have method to split the entire data flow diagram in to a
smaller part into a leveling which we will look at later on and so that the
smaller diagrams are once implemented then they got to have linkages
putting all these diagrams
and data elements which are there in data flow and data store
later on we have to look at how to organize all those data in the files and
what is known as a data base
and there are number of important principles you have to take into account
while organizing this data in a data base
so that when you do an update there is no errors is keeping unknowingly or
when you delete some some parts unknowingly some other a parts or not
deleted so these are the issues which will be important when it comes to
the design of the data base
i am only talking about some files but very large whenever a company looks
at data resources data resources will go into a database
and something known as database management system which in computer science
curriculum it is a full fledged course which is normally taught later later
on in the curriculum but we will give you a general idea of what this all
about
and passing rules carried out with each circle of the

refer slide time (10:55)
[pic]


data flow diagram as a same the processing rules will giving either as a
structured English algorithm or as decision table and we look at them in
greater detail later on
and descriptive statement of operational tactical and strategic information
will be provided
also in done we cannot avoid writing some descriptive statement that means
you have to write carefully what you have done because of read by mangers
uh and pictures that data flow diagram  document flow diagrams are only
aids to understanding
but the word statement or write up is quite important and that is why i
think we are taught a communication skills a both written communication and
oral communication
here we had to able to clearly and precisely specify the  operational
tactical and  strategic information as a descriptive note
that means it is a one or two page write up which one has to able to read
data dictionary which consolidated all data elements which are data store
 so the next module we are going to look at

is known as feasibility analysis now i wanted to first understand what is
feasibility really mean from a dictionary point of view
so normally when a new words comes up it is good idea to go and look at the
dictionary
because all the general meaning lot of people described
so i went and looked at the dictionary and the dictionary the feasibility
is explain the mean is given the investigation to determine weather a
particular system is desirable and can also be uh actually made otherwise
weather it is desirable or it is practical ok
so there are two issues feasibility at the end of feasibility weather
deriving the system the idea is able to tell the management that what  you
have designing is practical it can be implemented ok
and that it is also desirable what you are going to do is can be useful
and not only useful it can be implemented
the end of this feasibility study has to make sure you have to convince
that management that whatever system you have proposing is practical and
can be implemented and it will be a desirable system as the company is
concerned
so this particular module we have to we look at the the question i said
there are two  keywords which i used one is practical and one is desirable
ok
and the question of desirability is based on the what kind of goals you
want to attain ok
so you have to look at how to formulate the project goals and of the goals
also have to be quantified
what you meant by quantified is qualitated statement will not always do i
will explain in wider length in this lectures
the difference between what is meant by a quantification and qualitative
description
as a engineers we normally always look at numbers or something which is
quantifiable ok
because that gives us more confident
Quantification is very important also from the  management point of view to
attainment by that the system is practical
and you have to look at the alternative solution because many ways of
obtain the solution
Americans say that there are many ways getting the cat
but i dont like that term there are are many ways are cooking potatoes i
might say
there are so many ways are cooking potatoes each one has got some good
features and some bad features alrigtht
so you have to pick the particular right way of the cooking
to get what you deserve ok
some people may desire setting method of cooking because their goal may be
different
if a person is looking at very low oil content or fat content in what you
cook the potatoes then he will normally steam it and not putting the oil in
it
somebody is looking something which is crisp and so on and he will fry it
and put a lot of oil
so that may be alright for some people it may not be alright for some
people
so the point we are going to make is what is good what is considered good
in certain situation may not be good in some other situation
so they have to cooked at some ultimate decision maker is
the person is going to eat the potato ok
similarly the ultimate decision maker in the case of a system is going to
develop is that the person is going to use that system
so he has to tell you
which of these alternate solutions is preferable based on number of factors

like feasibility technical feasibility technically do i have the where the
to be able to implement it
operationally can i do that
and economically that means money
infact i have to explain in length what is meant by technical feasibility
what is meant by operational feasibility
and what is meant by economic feasibility
these are the things you are going to learn
and the cost benefit analysis
what is meant by cost benefit analysis is there could be many ways of
cooking potatoes
each one may require a different cost ok
we just steam it it doesnt need oil or things like that
but if you fry it you can use oil and masala and stuff like that
so the cost is going to go up
so the benefit one has to decide
so the question of cost benefit is in terms of how much is going to cost
and what benefits i am going to get
again benefit is going to be quantified
and just if you say that it will be good for you that doesn't satisfy
people
so you have to look at the quantification of the cost benefit is generally
regarding the quantification cost is known
so many  fees we are paying for  doing the system and what is the profit i
am going to get
benefit is normally in terms of savings
there are many types benefits one can thing about and i look at what
benefits
because sometimes money may not be only issue
it could be customer satisfaction may be an issue
so certain terms benefits are not entirely quantifiable but you can
generally understand but ultimately you try to do
ultimately you bring up the point where you try as soon as possible
quantified because people dont like un quantified specifications of
benefits ok
and what are the documents feasibility  report the end of this phase
and once the document the hole at the end of the game at the end of
feasibility analysis we really come up with the particular method of
meeting the require mental system
for srs is already developed and the particular method you have come now
so you may in the process find it s end requirements can be met
but only met at very high cost and so you may not decide to do that or you
may find out that certain requirement is specified may not be possible to
make it technically because of lack of equipment or technology is not at
there to do it ok
similarly operational we may not have people to do it or you may not have
program ability to do it
so all these issues again have to looked at
so that ultimately you go back to s rs
and only come up with the what is feasible and what document also cost
benefit so then the development phase
when you develop the deliver the system the uh user can compare what you
promise against what you actually gets doing the evaluation phase and
beside weather you have done a good job or not ok
and that is the whole idea of reworking the s r s after the feasibility

refer slide time (20:37)



[pic]

the motivation for looking at the feasibility study is before management
decide to implement a computer based system they should know the goals
which will be met by the system
what will be the goals met by the system and i cannot describe this
entirely in a vacuum you have to take specific cases i look at particular
case with some details to really talk about the goals
because goals depend on system these goals must be quantitative goals
so that when the system is implemented it is possible to compare
quantitatively the achievements that is the goals which are set
so the achievements of goals that is that comparison is that much which add



refer slide time (21:32)





[pic]


essentially explains to you how it is done
the analyst should able to estimate what hardware and human resources will
be needed to implement a system to meet the goals
so that is essentially require
require to be able to find about cost
because the cost of people cost of equipment and so on
analyst must examine methods to implement system and the resource needs
because different methods have said or possible and each one may cost
different amount ok
and the cost benefit analysis should be carried out for each alternative
you got multiple alternatives three or four ways of doing it
you say this way is going to cost this much and this going to benefit and
you compare and based on the cost benefit the ultimately the user will
decide which one he wants


refer slide time (22:39)




[pic]

um this analysis will be essential for a management to decide which
solution they would like to implement ok
so that they said the multiple solutions are given which one they can
actually implement
and the feasibility of meeting goals with the available technology and
human resources cost benefit are important parameters for informed
management decision making
so the determination of feasibility meeting the goals
and also the uh uh  uh as i said human resource requirement and available
technology and there are various parameters which ultimately go to make up
this study feasibility study

refer slide time (23:31)


[pic]
so the primarily we are going to learn how to formulate the goals to be met
by the information system to be designed
how do you come up with the goals
how do quantify the goals and how to obtain the alternative solutions to
satisfy the goals
so these are three important learning goals and besides that
how to access the feasibility of implementing alternative solution thus
many solution are there to look at the feasibility or or of each of those
how to compute the cost benefits of which alternative feasible solution and
then how to prepare the system proposal of potential user of a system so
these are the primarily learning goals of this particular module

now at the end of the information gathering phase which we discussed
earlier you find out the deficiency of current system and consensus arrived
at on requirements and s r s document is prepared that is what we saw
and the deficiency of the current system the example i took was that of a
hostel information system where i said the warden  that the deficiency of
current system is that the daily rate for the student is going
because there is no proper control for inventories or the amount of
purchase which is made and vegetables and so on perishable if they buy
excess they go waste
so the actual cost of student of goes up
so he only says that the reference the cost is too high
the other reference he says is that the students don't pay their bills in
time
when they dont pay the bills in time we have perpetual problem of trying to
meet our budget ok
we dont have money to go buy things so on
so we had a some methods of being showed is the student being on time
so these are the things kind of problems which he pointed out
one more thing he pointed out that is we dont consolidate our requirements
so that we can reduce the number of trips to go and buy it
if we consolidate then we can reduce the number of trips and that will
reduce the total cost
so number of these efficiencies in the current system was pointed out and
urge you to go back and study chapter four in detail to where the interview
the wardens are given at the end of that the deficiency is pointed out more
in terms of a certain statements of anything which is  in terms of the
quantification and the consensus is arrived at
the consensus which is arrived at in that particular case that means
agreement arrived at is that it is important to be able to uh do two things
one is that reduce inventory
and reduce the daily rate
and make sure the daily rates do not vary from month to month ok
suppose the daily rate about fifteen rupees this month per day fifteen
rupees per day
next month it should not become twenty five rupees
because student cannot budget
so you really have to have some thing which is plus or minus two or three
percent within that it should keep it
and one more um um um consensus was that one should be able to actually
find out this students are perpetually delaying payments
so the warden should be able to have a list in front of him
saying these students are delayed payment beyond five days or ten days
whatever that decision has to be made about number of days about number of
days
so you can call the student and request him to pay or take some action
so the payment is made
the consensus is also found that the important part is in terms of the mess

there is a cost of the daily rate
the prom collection of bills and so on
but it is not very important this time to have a database of students and
room allotments and so on that is the later priority
and said to transfer about the case study
so based on that prioritization you arrive at what you want to implement
that what meant by consensus and system requirement specification documents
prepared
so note down deficiencies in the current system

refer slide time (28:50)

[pic]


found while preparing the s rs document
and set the goals to remove deficiencies
and quantify this goals
and find alternative solutions to meet this goals
so this is actually what we have discussed and we have to follow
and evaluate feasibility of alternative solution taking into account
constrain the resources
rank order all the alternatives and discuss with user
prepare a system proposal by management approval base on the rank order


refer slide time (28:50)

[pic]

define the goals and sub goals of the proposed system

refer slide time (29:33)


[pic]

so verbal statement you have to quantify into goals
example given here send a bill soon after a month end is un quantified
where as quantified statement is send bill within five days or the end of
the month ok
and un quantified thing is what keep the mess bill reasonably constant from
month to month month
quantified thing would be  keep the mess bill at fifteen rupees per per day
plus minus one rupee that is quantified plus minus one rupee is the
quantification of a reasonably close to fifteen rupees because reasonably
close mean fifty paisa or five rupees says that is not un quantified
so quantified means exactly what what you try to achieve in terms of
numbers
so in fact in every example you have to able to come with specific numbers
and that is meant by quantification of goals


refer slide time (29:33)

[pic]

find out weather it is possible to meet these goals
find out the cost of meeting each goal
and find the cost benefit analysis
and benefit is going to be quantified also what is the game name by benefit
quantify in the case of mess bill fifteen rupees approximately plus minus
one rupees is a quantified goal
what is the benefit
only benefit you can say as the intangible benefit intangible in the sense
that students are happy
bills do not vary vary widely what other benefit is there which can be
quantified
only other quantification  of the benefit may be the because of a control
of inventory and so on
the mess bill it self it come down
so if you say that the mess bill being twenty rupees to in a month has come
down to fifteen rupees that's you can say quantifying the benefit means of
the twenty rupees i will bring it down o fifteen rupees by the method i am
going to follow
so that means i have benefited five rupees for every twenty rupees
and whatever money i spend
to achieve this must be compensate with the reduction in five rupees of the
bill
so this is the kind of point
so the one can be just satisfaction once it can come fifteen rupees
satisfied
but then quantification is in terms of the fact that the total cost of the
system inventory and so on it kept come down
the pinpointing missing functions unsatisfactory performance and excessive
cost of operations
what we really mean by   these things a missing functions unsatisfactory
performance
excessive cost of operations
uh missing function in a existing system a missing function may be in the
case of  hostel information system the function which has missed was the
fact that


the current system does not have any means of filing out who are the
habitual offenders of not giving their bills in time
so they there is missing on current system has no way
in which you can find out otherwise it doesn't have the means of finding
out
who has not paid ok
so this function is missing
un satisfactory performance that the current system of mess bill is not
being kept cost at fifteen rupees
it is widely varying so performance is not satisfactory
so i want to have performance which is to keep that bill with in a certain
range excessive cost of operation again it is related
excessive cost of operation against
spending say five thousand rupees and buying vegetables every month which i
estimate i come out i am spending seven thousand rupees because lot of
vegetable being wasted
so excessive cost of operations is because of the fact that there is no
proper control
so the whole idea of the new system must be remove the missing functions
there is have some means of sending out the bill in time and getting this
getting the list of students not paid and so on
and to remove the unsatisfactory performance you need to have to keep the
mess bill cost plus minus one rupee as i said and extra cost of operation
bring down the mess bill
because the vegetable cost is gone down
your bill rate is also go down that is what meant by excessive cost of
operation reduced

[pic]

set goals to remove deficiency and provide competitive advantage so the
goals this case may be the goals quantitative goals may be to bring down
the mess bill twenty five rupees to fifteen rupees that is a quantified
goals a quantified goal may be that bring down to a vegetable cost from
seven thousand rupees  to five thousand rupees a month so these are all
goals which is required to meet and to meet these deficiencies are given
there

refer slide time (36:02)

[pic]

as i said goal the characteristics of goal is should be quantified it
should not be just uh uh lazy
actually realizable within the constrain and organization system
what you mean the realizable that means you have the methodology of being
able to meet this goal
for instance suppose you say i want to bring down the mess bill to twenty
five rupees to ten rupees it may not be realizable
because the here if you take minimal amount of menu reduced menu and
variety and so on cost the basic cost of the items which you buy may such
that it is impossible bring down to ten rupees
so it is un realizable goal
but all the goal which within the constrains of cost of items in the market

cost of milk cost of vegetable and so on is something which you can meet
so the levels which has been realistic
 you can not just say  because the analyst in the beginning tells the
warden you can computerization or bring down the mess bill from twenty five
rupees to ten rupees
first of all we wont believe you
just by computerize how can bring down the bill basic cost is so much all
the items
and everyday the items cost are going up so always inflation ok
the point is that one should not promise some thing which is not realizable
and then you had break in to up sub goals regards what is meant by sub
goals is that a major goal may be bring down the mess bill ok
but how to achieve it
you have to have sub goals one way of achieving that is that you had to
reduce the inventory
there is a reduce inventory uh again you have to quantify the reducing the
inventory
that means you say that current inventory cost is  x rupees
i will bring down the inventory cost to point nine x rupees ten percent i
will reduce it so it is sub goal which will ultimately lead to main goal of
reduce to daily rate ok
ans similarly i can say which is total vegetable cost is five rupees i will
bring down vegetable cost from five rupees to may be point eight y ok
and these are points what is meant by breaking down the major goal into sub
goal and you can meet each of sub goal
each sub goal must also be quantified and it should agreeable to all
concerned

refer slide time (39:02)

[pic]


that is sub goal to bring down to mess bill fifteen rupees from twenty five
rupees
but i end up giving everyday potatoes and no other vegetables and so on it
may not be agreeable see
if you keep your menu balanced and not much of a change the original menu
just given in the hostel
and yet  be able to meet the reduce cost so that is a point
it will be agreeable you must have the consensus also from the ultimate
consumers in this case students saying that i will give you the balance
menu
and i will not going on repeating menus going on day after day i will have
proper kind of menu planning and yet i will bring down the cost
so that is essentially what you meant by something which agreed to
everybody
in general goals must not only remove a deficiency but also give a system
which is superior to those of the competitors of the organization
otherwords
because this is a general point
so i am now going little bit  beyond my simple case study when you are in
the real field in go to company

                                    ,

like for us to take a you are going to a go to a  hotel and say i am going
to implement a hotel management system you will have some method of doing
it you get goals and sub goals and  you essentially say at the time of
proposal you give only a brief proposal
because you don't want to spend lot of money and time and doing that here
doing proposal based on the conversation you had
your competitor also giving pre proposal so ultimately many competitors
will be there for the particular contract of computerize in the hotel
system
so your goals must your system must not only meet all the goals which are
quantified
but also meet it in a superior way compare to the competitors who are given
ok
what have you mean by superior way there are two way in which you can talk
about superiority and so on
so in any situation like many people go to a hotel and say that they will
implement their their computerized system for their management to the hotel
there are many issue in a hotel like booking the rooms planning the menus
and preparing bills collecting reservations whole lot of issues are
involved and you have to give goals of each of them and after giving each
of them you have to able to quantify by putting that computer how much are
they are going to save
in terms of operations of the hotel and you also have to specify
what is the cost you are going to what charges you are going to charge to
that hotel will be able to implement the system
there are two cost involved here
one is the cost of equipment they have to buy may be pc s and so on       `
which the hotel may have to buy and networking all infrastructure they have
to buy
all above  that they also have to buy the software things like Microsoft
some accounting systems or some other accounting system must may be there
in the market
so that software cost also included is there hardware cost and then
software cost that is resulting what company has to pay that the hotel has
to pay
besides that they have to allocate people   to work with you doing the
system development
so their cost is also involved so that there is  all the cost of company
plus they have to pay you your fees for you analysis your programming
your
effort your implementation making satisfactory to them and so on so give a
certain quotation and also certain time constraints say that i will charge
you x rupee
and i will finish the job in four months time or something like that
your competitor may charge something else and finish the job in three
months time
his charge may be higher but he finish faster so the benefit the hotel may
think that they want it faster they willing to pay more
so the point really is you had to have system which is superior superiority
can be in terms of the function which it means
and the flexibility it has got apart from the cost and quality ok
many software companies win contracts based on not only the cost
 but based on their quality which you assure ok
and the special goals the meet which some other competitor can not meet
so the point is that a good system software analyst must be able to very
clearly examine the important goals and sub goals and make a quotation to
meet the goals and sub goals which are somewhat better than his competitor
so even if your costs are little higher
they may be willing to give the contract because your system is superior
so this is what meant by a document  generally remove deficiency but a
superior system to compare to what is being given by your competitors

so now let me get back to my case
we in the case we said that the miss expenses are divided among students on
a daily rate of derived
this is what i have been saying all along and there is student and chief
warden who kind of managing the  entire hostel but there is a student
committee which besides in the menu
and besides on what should be a daily rate stuff like that student can
afford
i am taking example of a our institution where the mess is  run by students
and not by contractors ok
many of the good organization our students running it
reason why student  run it is normally it is lower cost and they get better
food
and its also a good idea for students run the mess because they get
experience of the real life system of how the mess operate how to deal with
people and different levels so on
and it is also good idea for computer science students to kind of get
involved themselves in this activity to be able to computerize in fact many
of the iits and so on
the mess system is actually implement by the students computer science
students ok
and they give a good service that is a good experience for them of
developing a system
and mess bill has to be prepared and to send of promptly to the end of each
month
so the when they say promptly there is something which is not quantified
and in the case of mistake stores requirement not forecast
the inventory not only say inventory levels is  very high
so cost is going up and so the missing function is that the requirement of
stores is not forecast that  you can buy an amount which is necessary and
sufficient ok
and you don't run out of items and you dont have excess items in fact
inventory control is very important in all companies
because inventory is dead investment
what you meant by dead invest meant it is there you don't have to paid for
it and we dont use it
that means your interest cost for that is gone
so you always try to reduce the total inventory within the constraint being
able to meet the meet the requirements ok
and purchases are not consolidated
many trips are made to the city and that in creases the cost of system and
so on it is another point which is during the discussion with the students



refer slide time (48:53)
[pic]

and daily rate calculation not frequently updated in other words see the
daily rate one of the goals was to keep the daily rate at fifteen rupees
plus minus one ok
if you wait till the end of the month to calculate the daily rate it may
turn out that certain things are gone out of control where as if you update
day by day you find about one week
your  daily rate is gone up beyond one rupee then you may try reduce or buy
cheaper vegetables or reduce inventory and so on and go on a economy dry to
try to bring down the cost
so at the end of the month you have a you meet your goal ok
so you have frequent update while you are actually buying and so on ok
that is the missing function currently
menu not planned for balanced nutrition and low cost
currently menu has has occur arbitrary  ok
and we would like to use a computer have a balanced nutrition and low cost

deficiencies are bad performance and unsatisfactory performance billing is
not accurate and prompt that is one thing which is having mention  again
and again
student bills are not itemized that is student are giving bills but it
better to itemize
and what is meant by itemization students may bring guest on a certain date

so you say that you brought two guest an sixteenth of march and these
amount of money which is for that guest
you got something extra on this day you ordered extra milk or extra eggs
and so on on this day  so that is itemized
student also kind of knows that extras which has been charged in his mess
bill is as per the what he actually get
there is a saying amount of  itemization giving a confidence to student is
not being overcharged

stores are issued to cooks arbitrary  that current system the stores are
the items are given to the cooks in a not in control way
suppose he is going to cook for hundred student there is requirement of
certain amount of rice
if you give currently it has to the cooks were being taking out what ever
the require
but if you want to control the bill you have to have clear idea of how much
of rice is require for hundred students only issue that
and make sure that the rice the total rice doesnt go down or you know there
is wastages is not there
so that again we have the quantification in the computer you can date the
exact issue of items based on the number
number may vary in fact  the example i have given is that the student is
going to be not using the mess for five days in a at a stretch he is given
a rebate
so at the even time all hundred students need not be there
Particularly if it is a holidays some three four holidays coming together
many may have gone to gone of
in this case reduction must be there in what is a issue on based on the
number of people there in fact many hotels and other organiasations we will
make sure about the number of guests and only issue based on that
because otherwise there is no control that means that the possibility of
preference which is always there in a system
payment to vendors are not prompt
if vendors are paid in time after you buy items within ten days you pay
then your cost will not be high
if you dont pay for the month is going to increase your cost saying that
this is not a good fellow he has to pay so
because his money is tied up ok
large variation in the mess bill every month
these are deficiencies is which i have been pointing out fifteen rupees or
on month or twenty rupees next month and thinks like that

un paid and long out standing bills from students
students are not paying in time
extras and rebates not reflected in the stores issues
other wise the extra guest on particular day then you had issue more
so of course normally in some hostels they are going to bring a number of
guests you had to inform them one day ahead of time
that tomorrow i am going to bring five guests or six guests so that they
can actually plan on that and issue
so these are items which are deficiencies high operational cost

frequent small purchases due to  high cost
high transport cost due to not consolidating stores requirements

so once you come with this once you have the all deficiencies just not them
as you know one two three four
saying starting with one and you can see one point one and one point two
and so on
there is the reason why i have  done that
one it is going to lead to certain methodology are certain goal
and to meet deficiency of two
two point one two point two as i have to set another goal
to meet three and so on i got to meet third goal
that is a way in which we note down one two three and sub goals within that

and then we go to formulation of the essential main goals based on these
deficiency
the main goals are based on medium deficiencies and that essentially what
we will be doing i think i will go in to a much greater detail next time
before that
i would like you to read chapter four again
refresh your mind about that hostel case study because many of things i am
going to saying may look very strange to to you unless you studied it and
the advantage having a book like this there is description of this case is
there in great length
so chapter four have this book analysis and design of inventory system
if you read this then next lecture will be able to follow much better and
also could read chapter six or feasibility analysis so that you prepared
when you come to this lectures
thank you
