we will consider this time as  the  first  part  of  my  talk  qualities  of
information
quality is a concept which is not very precisely definable
it is some something like a beauty of a person
but one one one sees the quality the person knows that it is a good  quality

so the exact definition is not really there
but on the other hand if there are certain  properties which  the  resulting
information after processing follows and if  you  are  make  sure  that  the
method of collecting data as well as passing  data  follow  certain  minimum
standards required standards then the resulting effort will be  that  of  an
information of good  quality
we have been emphasizing  right  from  the  beginning  that  information  is
processed data
so in order to ensure the quality of information you have  to  first  ensure
the correctness of data and you have  to  also  ensure  the  correctness  of
processing
so the most important part or the basic requirement is accuracy in terms  of
the correct data input and correct processing rules which you follow
normally processing rules  are really incorporated in some kind of program
so the program has to be correct in order to be  able  to  ensure  that  the
processed data and information is also correct
that is very whole saying in data processing called gigo g i g o garbage  in
garbage out
what it really means is  that  if  the  data  input  is  incorrect  whatever
processing you may do the output is going to be incorrect or  not  of  right
quality
this [3.52...] every thing
you may have the best possible recipe to make the dish like upma
but if you give input where the [4.07..] which is given  is full of sand
whatever you make in  terms  of  correct  recipe  following  and  doing  the
correct process in cooking the output will be not so edible
so this is always important to make sure that the input data is correct
now a number of  methods  of  ensuring  that  whatever  data  you  input  is
reasonably correct
you have to make sure and
in fact later on in this course you will see in fact  whole  lot  of  almost
whole lecture i will do it later on to see how to  ensure  the  accuracy  of
input data which gets into a system
the reason i am emphasizing it again  and  again  is  that  when  you  write
programs in a class room or small projects  and  so  on  [refer  slide  time

the volume of data you deal with is not very very large
volume of data is may be at the  most  hundred  or  two  hundred  data  data
points you work with
but in real data processing  systems  the  volume  of  data  you  handle  is
enormous
for instance if you are going to process the examination results of c e t
c e t is taken by lakhs of candidates and  so  the  number  of   input  data
which get into the program to be  processed will run into several lakhs
so when the volume becomes very large it is much more  difficult  to  ensure
correctness at every point
so that is the reason why one has to have special methods of  ensuring  data
correctness when you are dealing with large volumes of data
because typically most real life data  processing  systems  will  deal  with
laksh and lakhs of data
not a small amount of data
of course the correctness of program is different issue
there is a lot of work which is going going on  in  terms  of  ensuring  the
correctness of program
that is from the given  specifications to get to the right program  do  that
it is itself is  a major challenge in a soft ware design and lot of time  is
spend on various methods of ensuring the quality of correctness of  programs
or processing rules in this case
so first thing is accuracy
but that is not sufficient
because quality has a pointed out is a not a quantified one single scalar
it depends upon a number of different aspects or  the  information  you  get
out with
just like you know beauty is not a single thing
because when you say about beauty of a girl you don't really say  say  about
how her face looks
but you also look at the way  she  reports  herself  various  other  aspects
which are there
it is not a single quantity which defines a necessary thing like beauty
so there are other aspects which you have also to  consider  and  the  other
most list many of them and i will explain  what  each  one  of  them  really
means
at the end  whatever  processing  you  do  to  provide  information  to  the
management or to people to use it information
what i mean by management is  that you may be actually looking at  operation
day to day data processing
or you may be let you  know  tactical  information  to  come  out   of  this
operational  information  or   strategic   information   whatever   be   the
information which you present
all of them have to adhere to these quality standards and um
so the important second aspect of a quality is what i  call completeness
by completeness you mean in processing all the data which are  relevant  for
that processing should be taken into account or incorporated
you should not by mistake leave out some part of the data which is there
imagine c e t  research processing where you forgot to include one  sentence
data completely
the sentence data is not included when  you  do  the  processing  ultimately
what you get is these certain students who took the  exam  in  a  particular
centre are not in the results
so there will be fearer all over the place
so this is situation where the input data is not is  not  complete  in  some
part it is missed
may be due to carelessness may be what ever it is you really  have  to  make
sure what ever data has to be   taken  into  account  has  been  taken  into
account
there must be  timely  what  i  mean  by  timely  is  information  which  is
presented too late is not much use
therefore for instance you expect a newspaper to come every morning to  give
you news of what happened in previous day and so on
people read news paper every morning to be able to  be  informed  about  the
current events and if suppose it is delivered at one day late then  that  is
as good as doing throw in an waste basket
some thing which is not coming on time is very often not  use  full  at  all
for any purpose [refer slide time 10.44]
[pic]


so timeliness  means when the information is required at that time you got
to present it
there is no point in delaying it
for doing  for instance day to day  stock taking the result of what is the
stock at the end of the day should be known at the end of the day
there is no point of talking about what stock was there only for
[11.16....]
so if you take a long termed process and your results are always out of
date then the decisions you take will not be correct
because that will be based on out dated information
so every thing has got to be timely
there is also quality called trustworthiness
trustworthiness is some thing  different from completeness
completeness means you include all data items
trustworthiness means intentionally you should not leave out certain data
so that the results is good okay
so you cannot trust that information if it happens that you have a you have
not included unpleasant information
for instance if you are presenting to a visiting group about the
performance of your company and if you remove from that presentation many
transactions where effectively you made a loss then the result you give are
not trustworthy
soon or later to be find out that what has been given is incorrect and is
been done intentionally then of course it's also an offence
um in fact there are reason past many such situations of a reason that your
companies have hidden information which are not pleasant like certain kind
of losses which company made you are not made known to the stock holders
and so they come up in fact in america  with new law which punishes people
who hide information intentionally and some of them are actually going to
jail
similar things are happening all over the world
that is the because of computer processing information people and also
because of the fact the volume of data is increasing in leafs and  pounds
[13.37...] to get into every aspect is very difficult
so certain amount of trust is based on management and so trust the the
management which looks after the company should ensure that whatever they
do is trustworthy
the other quality is what we call is relevance
that is relevance means some thing which is necess which is useful for a
person and if it is something which is not useful it is called irrelevant
take a very simple example when you open your e mail box every morning  you
find a few letters which are essentially meant for you
but whole lot of other letters come which are advertisements trying to sell
things like that and many people call it spam
in fact it is called spam
and all that spam hides the real information which you require namely the
letters which are written  for you
so the relevance of what you get from the e mail system is not very good
unless you have a some kind of a what is known as filter which filters out
all the unknown or spam information
it presents only the wanted mail to you and that is an important part of
any relevance
in fact this has taken a greater and greater importance with the coming of
the automated search engines on the internet
search engines people use all the times like google now a days is commonly
used by students and everybody to be able to search the web to get um
information which is relevant
you may like to find out for instance um what is the latest speed of a
durian [16.01...] ship which is made by which ever company that is the
fastest it is being made in the world today and um
you put a query which you have say d rams speed and so on
but many of these system will retrieve so much data that is a way through
that to really find out what is the one you really wanted
so it is like searching for a needle in a [16.33..] face pack take a long
time [refer slide time 16.33 ]

 [pic]

so many people in fact do not go to a search engine for a simple reason
that they will get two thousand heads  what they call heads two thousand
outputs when they really require only two or three outputs
so the relevance measurement in this case is that it is ninety eight
percent of what what you got is not relevant
only two percent is relevant
so that that means if that is  relevant information you have to look
actually wasting your time
so relevant information is essentially what any management needs for many
information system
of course i broaden my um broaden my area of information system to include
system such as google because after all it is also an information system
which searches the web
and in fact today's world it is important information system which every
body uses
so the better some body comes with the better so called search engine which
gives you higher relevance ratio that is what you get out of the net if
suppose ninety eight percent is relevant only two percent is relevant then
you normally switch that kind of an engine okay
of course there is no engine which is  you can really give you  hundred
percent
because very often people don't even know very clearly what they want
so they kind of put the search terms in a  very careless way and under you
pick a lot of whole of junk information coming on your screen
so relevance is very important from point your any system
brief summarize summarize information that is relevant summarize
information is very useful because brevity is the the say the the sole of
good writing as well as good systems
you um brevity essentially ensures that you get the essence of what you
require and a lot of inessential things are being left out
so briefness becomes much more important as you go up in the hierarchy of
any organization
 the higher the level of the manager in the organization the briefer will
be the information presented to him
because the higher level managers are highly paid for lot of things to do
and they don't have the time to do whole lot of  irrelevant saying which is
not um presented with brevity
or brief
so it is very important as you go along
in fact strategic information is suppose to be the briefest a lot and of
course operational information is quite detail
but even there i think a lot of operational information may not be all that
useful
so may like to kind of make sure that what you present is necessary and
sufficient for the purpose for which it is designed
another idea of quality is what is known as up to date
up to date and timeliness are two different concepts
what is meant by up to date is that all data up to the last minute is
included
like for instance if you take a news paper for example again
news paer may be timely
you will get in the morning first thing in the morning
but if the information contained in it the news contained in it is only old
or old news then it is not up to date even though it is timely
same way if you are processing data and you are leaving out current data
that is data of a um which happened in the very recent past i have included
all the data which happened in the earlier then what you are really getting
is not up to date
so um the advantage of using computers is  the speed which the machines can
process data
so this speed irrelevant is what you get out of the computer is not up to
date
so the speed has got to be matched with the the to the fact that you should
able to  include all the data within time you might say within quotes um
the the data is fed to the machine okay
so the this is important or as you have seen the newspapers up to press
time
when they go to the press time what ever news come in they include that and
sometimes they put it to the late news and saying that and in t v channels
and so on the the they have a breaking news saying that up to date the new
news is coming up
and they up date up date all the time
so between two channels t v channels channel which is able to break news
faster is considered a better channel whereas the channel which um is not
able to give new s immediately [refer slide time 22.34]

[pic]


but it can be delay right
so up to date ness is an important  quality
significance is another idea
that is significance is that when when something presented to you you
should be able to understand what really means
like for instance at the end of the year the finance minister presents his
budget
and the budget in a whole lot of numbers
those numbers do not make much sense to common man
but normally they give a pi chart circle
a chart in which they say out of the income i have received so much of
income has come from income tax
so they will show a pi that is thirty percent of income has come from
income tax some forty percent has come from indirect taxes and some part
has come from loans and so on
they show a chart and as soon as you look at the chart your quality in
terms of where the money has come from
similarly the budget is also going to say where the money is going to be
spend
so the same chart they will say that is this much percentage say thirty
percent is being spend on defense five percent on education ten percent on
health care and so on
and forty percent on fifty percent on salaries
people may really wake up saying that you are spending lot of money on
salaries
for people and not enough money on improving the education or improving the
infrastructure and so on
so by in large when you look at chart like that you can understand
immediately the relevance of what is being presented
and this this same point arises in day to day information processing also
because the budget is not only the budget of a country
but for a company they have to make a budget every year
and in that budget you have to say how much are you from which areas of
operation of the company are you getting highest percentage of money
so in this case i  will put more emphasis on that area which is um giving
me a lot lot of income
then i can ask the question which area is giving the higher profitability
so then in the profitable and loss account i have another chart which items
in the company's manufacture made the maximum percentage profit
then i would like to emphasize on producing more of that okay
so that is a these  kind of if you understand  significance of information
then you can take a decision which people call informed decision okay
informed decision in the long run make the  company go very very profitable
otherwise the company will start loosing money okay
so primarily then we talked about all the aspects of um quality
so quality considerations are important regardless of the time information
your designing
varieties information for operational reasons operational  information or
tactical or strategic any all of them require that quality
there you may emphasis on certain type of qualities for certain types of
information like for strategic decision making it is much more important to
be able to give information which is whose significance is understood and
also brief okay
and for operational information you require make sure that it is complete
that is trustworthy and you also make sure that it is up to date and timely
these are things which are essential for operational information
that doesn't mean that it is not relevant for or or  important for others
strategic information is also got to be up to date and timely
but what  i am trying to say is that some of the quality parts are lot more
important as you go higher up in the hierarchy than the others
by in large all these parameters of quality has to be satisfied in
designing any information system and you have to make sure of that
so having  talked about quality of  information and various um you also
look at different parts of a company and so on
now you get into the types of information systems which are normally
designed for for use
um the reason why i am going to talk about the types of information system
or varieties varieties of information systems is because each of them has a
certain role to play and they have they have got different names for that
reason
is always a very lot of lot of confusion in minds of people about the
terminology
i would like to divide the terminology of variety into three broad
categories
one is business data processing
business data processing primarily is day to day processing of large
volumes of data   and that is the one for instance which every company has
to do
so business data processing is an essential part of any system
you cannot avoid it
but it is all routine
once you have that then people confuse this business data processing with
what is known as management information system which is very often
abbreviated as m i s system or m i s
m i s is reason why it is confused with data processing is that both of
them are used by managers
so management information system is um  is also  based on the type of data
processing systems
but i would like to kind of look at it from the point of view of our
classification of tactical information
that is operational information is luminous as i said
tactical information is based on the tactical information and further
processing of operational information to get some amount of brevity and
relevance which is of use to middle managers for taking their tactical
decisions day to day
so the input from m i  s is the output of the business data processing
system
so the input is one and the output is m i s
management management information systems
a system which whose output is tactical information
next level next higher level is often called decision support system
as the new  employees this system is to ensure good decision making by tact
management of any company
so decision making is very often done by both middle managers and by top
managers
[refer slide time 31.24]
[pic]

but more more often  m i s results are presented to the  top  management  by
the middle management and use this [31.39..] results  to  be  able  to  make
some decisions using a system called decision support system
the nature of decision support  system  is  some  what  different  from  the
nature of a business data operating system
this i will explain as i go along
later on we will have greater explanation of what d  s  s  means  and  books
have been written on d s s because it is a fairly interesting area  of  data
processing and very challenging area of data processing um and so getting  a
decision support system very often is  very  important  for  a  company  and
general feeling among the community  of  people  who  do  soft  ware  system
design and so on is that we have not reached the stage very  good  stage  of
being able to give very good d s s
still lots of decision taken by companies particularly  strategic  decisions
taken by management top management is not only based on the  data  presented
by the by using or by massaging m i s operational system and so on
who ever about this they have to use a lot their own what is what  is  known
as great point data
that is data and things like that which i hear as a  [33.33..]  whole  rumor
and stuff like that and they use their general long term view where  economy
is going where the country is going and so they  they  bring  upon  whatever
facts and figures are presented to them also what is known as judgement
you know judgement and use this judgement combined with facts of figures  to
arrive that decisions which consider is a decision  which  will  lead  to  a
profitable in the long run
and these strategic decisions which are suppose to come from d s s  are  not
always um correct
very very very  large  number  of  companies  have  gone  into  difficulties
because they  took  long  strategic  decisions  by  reading  the  market  or
situations  some what incorrect
one very interesting examples which occurred  in the  very  recent  past  is
that two two which has happened
one is i b m for instance sold their  entire  p  c  business  to  a  Chinese
company called lenovo and one may ask see p c is a very large area
lot of people use p c's
why should that company which really invented that p c gave up their  entire
business to chinese company
there is a strategic decision
what what the top management feels is that may be the days of p c is  coming
to an end
some other technology is going  to come
the other important thing which which of course made them base  decision  is
that if you are looking for  profitability  the  amount  of  money  invested
amount of human resource invested the profitability of p c's is very small
because the margin you get in the sale of p  c's  is  very  very  small  few
percent
the competitors like dell and so on who are able to  cut  cost  which  large
company find difficult to cut cost
so high use of profitability on p c's are going down
whereas profitability in another area like servers  which  for  higher  uses
for the number of servers they sell the percentage money they  get  is  much
more
so even the volume may be very low but the percentage volume may  be high
so in the balance sheet they find the  contribution  which  comes  from  the
server is higher
so may be if you emphasize  on  that  spend  our  money  as  well  as  human
resource and every thing on that and sell this off and  get  as  much  money
you can get from that and plunk it into other area
so  this  is  kind  of  a  decision  based  decision  support  system  which
effectively gave them this chart giving the profitability of  servers  which
is profitability of p c's
of course this only one what i would call numerical aspect which you had
but all the other aspect is that why itself gut feeling feeling that may  be
in the long run is going to be a um going to be some kind  of  a  saturation
or profits going down things like that
on the other hand [37.32] acquired a p c company called compact and  made  a
larger company
and they found having done that they are loosing money
so that is gain
similar decision in one case they sold off their p c business in the   other
case they acquired a p c business
so but the what what is happened is that  the  acquisition  about  the  p  c
business by h p made their profits go down
immediately the stock holders or the people share holders were very  unhappy
and what they did was sat sat with the person who took the decision
that is the top management top manager of h p and because  of  taking  wrong
decision strategic decision he lost the job okay
so in other words these are what i would  say  the  judgement  is  incorrect
okay
but partly it is based on data because Compaq is making good  money
but probably they didn't look at they didn't  look  at  the  possibility  of
competition and so on
so strategic decisions is also some times bad fact on the other hand
but inform decision support systems are correct information fed  to  d  s  s
helps a lot in terms of coming up with  a type of a decision
let us sta start with the lowest of run of  the  information  system  namely
business data processing systems
business data processing system as i said is a typical example  of  business
data processing system would be a system to process the c e t results
as i pointed out the input is lakhs and lakhs of data
so all this data enters the processing system
and now you have to make sure that the data which is being fed  to  whatever
program you have written is complete and it is correct
so you have to make sure that errors are removed
so it is called editing
in the editing you use a lot of rules lot of rules toms   as  well  as  real
rules and sometimes if you [40.37....] proper editing that  data  that  gets
in is corrected or in correct
the results would be would be very bad
see unnecessarily some some student may loose opportunity because  of  wrong
data entry
so it is the responsibility of data being entered to make sure
so edit edit programs do that
simple example of an editing is i have given as like say in c e t there  may
be three subjects or four subjects or whatever number it may take
so if it turns out that after data entry  you  find  that  a    student  got
ninety and ninety in two subjects  and  got  zero  and  zero  in  two  other
subjects
the probability that that data is wrong or very high
so the  system  in  the  edit  stage  should  be  able  to  point  out  such
discrepancies so that one can go back and check whether in correct  data  is
entered and correct it at that point itself
so checking or editing programs are very very very  important  part  of  any
data processing system
in fact i remember that  in  companies  which  use  to  do  a  massive  data
processing like for instance seeing  the  results  results  of  examinations
like um  you  know  matriculation  examination  s  s  l  c  examination  pre
university examination and so on
those companies use to spend a lot  of  effort  and  time  in  writing  edit
programs
and very often when a student joins a company as a trainee one of job  given
to that person was to write the edit programs
to kind of make sure that the student should understand  the  importance  of
data getting into system is being correct [refer slide time 42.48]
[pic]

later on in this course we will look at  in  great  detail  the  methods  of
variety
and editing there are two aspects of editing of course removing  in  correct
data
the other aspect of editing is that including all data
what i as  i  pointed  out  is  if  you  lost  if  you  didn't  include  one
particular centre then what you end up with is a very bad result
similarly in a single centre suppose say fifty five students took  the  test
and you entered only fifty four data then you miss one
there must be some method of checking completeness
so this is called control
so at the end of a batch say  fifty five you put one  control  which  counts
and says i have really read so many input data and that  number  is  smaller
than the number of students who took the exams they  immediately  know  that
it is in complete
so editing and controls to say see whether it is complete also reasonable
for example if you are you are processing data of a class and  you  look  at
the [44.18....] and for a for a say class ten in a school you  find  an  age
to be thirty five immediately you have to  have  a  doubt  whether  data  is
entered correctly or not
so this is what is meant by reasonable decision
you have to be you have to be a reasonableness about what is being entered
so apart from the um from the what i mean by see in correct data entry  very
often leads to unreasonable things
so that that is some thing which comes out with control things
so you have bend  to that means what you really do is input  data  is  being
taken and your polishing it or sending it to a laundry to clean  it  up  and
take out all the in correct data correct all of it and what ultimately  gets
into the system is normally stored in what is known as the data base
so before things get into the data base you have to make sure  what  is  put
into data base is correct in complete
so the organization of data base is only how to really  organize  all  those
massive volume of data
but what gets into that is what comes out of the  earlier  part  of  a  data
processing system namely editing control jacks and so on
and also certain aspects which are spot audit  if  you  do  spot  audit  you
find out anything which is which  intentionally  has  been  changed  whether
those things are also done
we will look at  in detail as soon in later of the course [refer slide  time
46.17]

[pic]

in data processing itself there are two broad methods of data processing
one is called the online transaction data processing the  other  is  called
batch processing
see the examination processing which i talked  about  is  an  example  of  a
batch processing
because you bunch all the result all the data
that is having taken the examination marks are assigned and the  end   marks
of each student with  roll numbers and so on
you are taking as i said lakhs and lakhs of these data together as  a  batch
and process it as a batch
these are routine data processing day to day
what i mean by day to day c e t is not day to day
c e t is a periodic say c e t is once a year
the other types of data batch processing which are periodic like pay roll
if you are doing a pay roll processing at the  end  of  the  month  to  give
salary to your employees you have to get the records of  all  the  employees
their salaries reductions all those things and process it and to  create  an
account and find out how much money is to be credited to  the  bank  account
of that employee and automatically that amount is credited to the bank
so this a periodic periodic type of a data processing
so pay roll is an example
there is also frequency can be daily pay roll is once a month
daily frequency is something like at the end of the day if you  are  finding
out the inventory in a company like if you are running a large retail  store
like food world something like that at the end of the day you would like  to
have the idea of the current stock position and the current  stock  position
is got to be there that you have to process at the end of the day
that is caught to be there
um depends upon um what you know the the methods may differ
but by in large it periodic data processing or if you doing cash  collection
at the end of the day you have to find out how much cash you have collected
so you add up all the cash whatever was entered in the cash register and  go
on up date you know adding up all that and give the cash at the end  of  the
day okay
so then at  the end month total monthly cash in flow
so these are things which are data processed
i mean batch processing
there is then the whole t p is something some what different it's called  on
line give up transaction processing
what is meant by online
it is being done immediately after the event
like for instance if you are  going  to  book  the  railway  ticket  at  the
reservation counter you are being processed online
because as soon as you give your request for a  ticket  that  form  whatever
information is entered in the form is entered by the clerk  and  immediately
that gets into the system
and while you are waiting the result comes out telling  you  whether  ticket
is available and if ticket is available your  ticket  is  also  printed  and
given to you
so online that sense that it is it is working while you are waiting
transaction means the slip you gave requesting for a for a seat in  a  train
once it is entered it is a transaction
one one one entry as you made and this triggers number of  other  things  in
the back ground
you know this this particular input will trigger look up in  the  data  base
to find out if there is a ticket available and create this ticket out
the reason why the term transaction process is being used  because  it  came
from the banking area
when you go to a bank and look present a cheque whatever is  in  the  cheque
is entered on the p c right away and there  is  a  transaction  there  is  a
money transaction
and the money transaction leads to a reduction  your  account  and  that  is
being debit in your account and you get money out
another very common example of online transaction processing  is  all  a  t
m's
a t m's are processing all over the place are really transaction  processing
machines
because you go  there  put  in  your  card  and  that  card  is  read  as  a
transaction and it triggers an action
the action triggering an action leads to a cash coming at your end
one of other issues  which comes with online transaction  processing  which
makes it some what challenging to design such systems um which is  primarily
the these challenges come because of  the  fact  that  there  could  be  two
transactions coming simultaneously on the same data and we have to  able  to
make sure that one of them is committed before the other one is committed
because both of them cannot conflict
i will give you a simple example
you may be with drawing money from a bank
at the same time your you may be given a t m your wife may doing your a t  m
transaction on the same account and so if there is not enough money if  both
of them are done without proper committing what i mean by committing  is  as
soon as one transaction is over your balance should go down
doesn't gone down the balance should remain the same
the other transaction also takes place then you get money which not in  your
bank
not in your account
so there is a mistake occurred
so this kind of a serializing of transactions becomes  important  in  online
transaction processing systems
of course batch processing i already talked about various  batch  processing
methods [refer slide time 54.12]

[pic]

in online transaction processing data base or master as is called  available
online like in ticket booking situation for you to be able to do  the  work
immediately
request in specified format accepted by from the requestor  has  a  form  or
something like that [refer slide time 54.38]
[pic]

and check the request for validity retrieve record from data base  and  take
appropriate action either  giving  your  tickets  or  not  not  giving  your
tickets tell you dividing less or whatever
so every trans online transaction process has got this  [refer  slide  time
54.56]

Where as in batch processing you collect batch of requests key  in  validate
or [55.06...] create request file
so in this batch you create a file [refer slide time 55.14]

[pic]

and this file  is  called  transaction  file  because  you  bunched  up  all
together as a file
and update master file using transaction file
in one one in [55.26...] the in other words the  transaction  file  gets  in
and one by one it goes in check the data base entries up dates it
at the end of the file the master file or  master  transaction  master  data
base gets updated
that's a new new state and then create the result file
like if you have a pay roll the result file will be a set of cheques  to  be
printed
and print responses for requests like exam exam processing also
in the case of requests is the is the the results of examination after  c  e
t create a result file
result file is printed and you get your big sheets of results which you  pin
on the board or put it in the paper whatever for the students to  understand
or know [refer slide time 56.20]
[pic]


in the difference between batch and [noise]  o  l  t  p  in  o  l  t  p  the
requirement is that the the response time should be very fast
what is  meant  by  response  time  is  from  the  time  you  initiate  your
transaction to time to get your result of transaction the lapse time  should
be small for obvious reasons
see while you are waiting in a queue to get you served for your ticket
you don't want to be wait half an hour for a ticket
as soon as you get first in the queue and you present your form very happy
you already stood for may be half an hour in  the  queue  and  now  you  are
happy that you got your turn
when you got  your  turn  to  take   another  half  an  hour  you  will  get
frustrated
the people don't like what you know waiting in queues and waiting so on  for
a simple reason that they think it's a waste of time
even that isn't waste of time and no body wants to be kind of  unnecessarily
stand on online and waste time okay
so the response time is very very important and response time should be  not
more than a minute or two okay [refer slide time 57.43]

[pic]


 it if it goes beyond five minutes people start fiddling around
response time also depends upon situation
while using up a computer p c and then you enter some thing and  the  result
doesn't come out and you waiting at that little hour  clock  goes  on  round
and round and round  you get very frustrated because response  time  is  not
good
when you are working on a terminal on a  p  c  you  would  like  to  have  a
response time of a few seconds two or three seconds
other wise you feel you know start fidgeting
fidgeting may be the computer is down  or  may  be  some  problem  with  the
machine
on the other hand the machine may be slow okay
so the point really is in any kind of online situation  is  very  important
to be able to get a quick response
in a batch processing system the requirement  is  not  immediate  processing
because any how  you have bunched up many tings together
see c e t examination results after you get the examination results  in  and
input the data require a lot of time because that is may be  manual  and  so
on
the computer time to process is not all that it  is  only  only  very  small
fraction of the total time
the time you give examination the time your result is declared
so that part what is more important is from the point of  view  of  computer
the computer's time  should be presented [refer slide time 59.36]

[pic]

so in other words the throughput the efficiency at which  it  get  processed
in the computer to reduce or minimize zip your  time becomes important
so throughput is important consideration for a batch processing system
in fact this throughput for is a response is a recurring  theme  in  lot  of
computer computer in fact entire computer science
when you do design for a computer for instance you can design a computer  to
maximize throughput
particularly there is you know designing  a  server  which  serves  mutilple
terminals on multiple p c's in a server from the point  of  view  of  person
who is get into your server from your p c you would like to have very  quick
response
so from individual point of view response is important
but from the person who manages that  server  he  has  to  get  the  maximum
utilization of that server to get as much work done as possible without  any
ideal time of the server
so from his point of view the throughput is important
so this kind of a design of a system you try to  balance  the  two  response
time versus throughput
if you try to improve the throughput the response goes  down
if you make response very good then throughput goes down
so this scale off is always there and  of  course  in  data  processing  you
really look at two different types of systems
o l t p the bench marks which are used or to asses the  performance  of  the
computer is quite different from what what you use in a batch
so at that time you know  very  clearly  that  one  is  um  one  is  minimum
response system other is a minimum throughput system
i think this is right time to kind of a stop this  talk  and  next  time  we
will continue with the discussion
