we saw that there are six major functional areas which are important in  any
organization and when you design information systems you  have  to  able  to
create a to the requirements in all these functional areas
the functional areas are [01.33...]
are production marketing materials management finance human resource
development and research and development
among these we did talk about production
not every organization may not have really production
um but um most organization you have
for instance if you are really a company which is retaining materials like
food mart then you don't produce anything
you only get things from your suppliers and then you market it
so on the other hand marketing is an important part of any organization
whether it be a organization like a motor car company or it be a um um food
world kind of company which does these sales the all materials they buy
from their um vendors or even um a company like google which is um which is
primarily based on verb and their major product is a um effective of
searching in
so um they also have to have what i would call marketing
because marketing is very crucial in case of any company
particularly so if you are in the area of software design and try to market
the software products or even hardware design and hardware products
if you are making for instance some personal computers some p c's or
something equivalent to that the company's future is very much depend upon
how well are able to market the product you made
it may be the best product
but um unless the marketing is effective one will not able to make any kind
of profit for the company
so marketing is an important aspect of every company
besides marketing of course every fa company will have functional areas or
finance
because without money nothing moves in this world
so you have to have finance and um you have to have um materials
there is  materials [04.08...]
i mean but materials may be there definitely in many most companies
including for instance a web based company like google their materials are
primarily the um the servers which they have to buy and they have to
maintain the servers they have to have huge bank of servers and [04.27....]

and so on
so materials are a part of many company
then apart from that human resource
no company can have without people and people are the most important part
of any organization and um the people how smart they are how satisfied they
are makes a lot of difference to particularly software companies
software companies depend upon the intellectual labor of the people
so their production is primarily software or writing programs or developing
systems
for them these are all done by people
so unless the people are satisfied and the people are productive
the company is not going to make reasonable product in reasonable time
so managing human resources in any organization is very important part
research and development is extremely important in all the newer
technologies
particularly in um telecommunications in computing in um even motor car
which are being made in searching [05.50..]
 and other types of web based products
it may not be all that important in companies like food mart which really
are selling
the research and development may not be an important aspect for them
but in general the um all the six functional areas will be there in most
organizations
and at least four of them will be there  in almost every organization
so now we look at marketing at some length
as usual we look at  of course the requirements of information  under the
categories of strategic requirements tactical requirements and operational
requirements
and among these the strategic requirements are really requirement by the
top management which are an overview of the business and they want to kind
of grow the business in the long run
and tactics are the second level of management who having desire on a
particular strategy
try to make the best out of the strategy in terms of what i would call
tactics um which um um last hour i pointed out an example of a cricket team
where strategy is something which is designed by the coach and the captain
and the selectors and so on
and the tactics on the field is  by the captain to to win the match
so similarly to make the company profitable tactics is extremely important
and the tactical information is what is the um major um work which is done
by the middle level managers
and of course operational information is luminous and that is required for
um day to day running and they require a lot of um that operational
information in order to able to we have informed  decisions at the
tactical  level as well as the strategic level
unless  you process [08.17...]
day to day information one had the the people on the top will not know
really what is going on day to day
they don't need to know everything
but they had need to have the digest of  what is the state of operation and
how the strategy are important on the operations
is the strategy left left to better operations or the strategy is left left
to worse operations
so they can change the strategy based on the results of the operations
which is  obtained by the operational information
so coming to marketing as i said marketing is the most important part of
the working in every company
and um even in a company such as google the marketing strategy has been
extremely important to make that company prosper
one may wonder what does a search engine  where do they make money and
infact they have to make money to survive
because you have continuously improve your [09.30...] engines
they get into new areas and so on
so they have to have reasonable profit coming into their company for being
able to be there for long all
and um everybody is trying to compete with this kind of business
now this strategy which um one has to look at is um what is the markets
what are the new market which are developing and what are the competitors
doing and what is the technology and demographic forecast and product
changes
and these are the marketing primarily consists of  methods of looking at
what the competition also does
so that you can appropriately change your method of working
to to look at an example of google what they started what they started with
search engine they had a twenty search engine already in the market
and they have to make in roads into this market where is  already a lot of
competition
so what do they do
in order to get into the market they give a free
so they started giving away the google free in the sense even today you can
log on to google google dot com and search the web and over sometime by
word of mouth and by people actually using it they found that their first
strategy in search engine was performing much better than the existing
search engines
so there is a lot of people starting to move to um using google
now when they start using google that means you have to  actually improve
it to survive
and in new way [11.41..] of course they can't be developing the software
free of cost and putting all the servers and so on with no revenue coming
in
the original revenue of course came from some so called venture capitals to
give money to get something started
but to sustain you have to market
now the marketing is very interesting in this case because people are used
to using this google being free
suddenly you say in order to use google you have to you have to pay some
money may be quickly your your market may vanish
so you have to take a strategy
 so their great strategic idea was that they went to advertising people and
then as i said people lot of people use of search engines and they search
for a particular item on the  web like for instance searching for um say um
information about cars
when they search for the information about the cars then i um will give
[refer slide time 12.56]

[pic]

along with the results of the search a little add saying that saying that
your your car is um one of one of the best in the market and so on um
but but not of course um is not a not a [13.13...]
in the sense that he is only putting an advertisement for you which
synchronizes with the search which a person is doing
so there is no point in giving some um advertisement regarding um um um
magi noodles when some body is looking for search okay
so it is extremely important to kind of synchronize what you pick
so that technology is developed with the result that they are able to
synchronize with advertising with the search and getting the money from
advertisers
so effectively they are getting money from the tutor and then giving it to
the free to [13.55...] okay
and as for as you are concerned you are very happy to continue to receive
free search and we don't particularly mind those adds as long as they are
not intrusive
if they intrude and some body gives a better search engine without all
those inclusions very quickly people will desert google and go to some
other search engine
so these are to be people has to look out for this strategy or the company
must be to continuously look out for these um these problems
and um if you take an another example of a motor cars the motor cars us as
you know today in india there are many company which are competing
on one hand there is old maruti which is being there for the oldest company
making many cars
then there this hyundai which  which came up and then there is tata which
also give up a motor car and there are other companies like feat and so on
which are there in the in the market
there are at least about half a dozen companies in the market making cars
so the top management has to take a particular strategic decisions of what
you have to do with different models of my car okay and um
how do i look for new markets of my car
 you know the indian market is some what getting saturated
in the sense that there are too many competitors competitors and so on
so they all look for say market in srilanka
do i  look for market in south africa or do i go to um um um far east or do
i go to europe
um um so these are issues in terms of looking for the markets and doing
some kind of a strategic decisions are either going to say market like
south africa or srilanka wiil decide not to
because the top management may be think that the [16.03...]
of being able to send the cars and getting profit out of that and the local
competition over come there may be quite difficult
and um another strategic decision you may take is that the way in which car
is sold
car is sold through a lot of agents who are over there in the um um so
called partners who market these cars and they give service after marketing

so some your car face after you buy it then they essentially try to help
you and get the car set right free of cost and even take your car from free
servicing or for free repairs at least for the first one or two years and
so on
so these are the issues strategy the strategic people has to decide
and you have to also look at the competitive strategy
suppose some body else is giving um some some kind of free service he says
three years it is free service and i will give one year free service is it
worth going for a three year service or it not worth going for a three year
free service that kind of decision one has to take
and um you also have to look at the demographic forecast
in other words where what i mean by demographic forecast is um how the
population growing and at what age groups are people there
in fact india has a large number of young people who are getting into the
um labor market starting to make reasonable amount of money
and now you have to see whether you had our strategy to meet the
requirements of this younger people and they may not require a large car
you may just try try a small car as a beginning thing
so maruti strategy has to come up with a small car at low cost
so once you buy the low cost and get used to it then you will become
slightly richer and want money to dispose then you decide you go for a
maruti itself with a better model or more expensive model and of course
they have a strategy may be if you are an x maruti owner  and you want to
abbreviate the maruti i will take back your old car and pay some money or i
will give some concession in the new car
so these are the kind of strategies which top management has to decide so
that they with once get the customer they try to keep the customer happy
right through possible his career so he goes on being loyal to you also
so again give some called loyalty bonus something to things of that type
so this essential what the companies try to strategy
now in order to do this strategy you also have to look at the tactics of
what you how how  do the middle management to help use the strategy and
make it to work
so um you have to look at for instance how [19.28...]
 the fact the strategic decision is taken that the you are the um existing
owner of a small car and you want to abbreviate to a bigger model then i
will give you  concession or i will take back your old car [19.46...]
you should know so that [19.50..]
technique should i use
how widely should  i i advertise how is it going to cost me
is it is it written in the advertising revenue worth the cost
also today there are plenty of different avenues of advertising
you can advertise in t v you can advertise in papers you can advertise in
the um um the web
as i said google's major revenue is advertising revenue you can advertise
in the web
so there are so many different areas to reach it you can advertise
but you have to decide which is more cost effective
so you really have to have an information and anal analysis of information
in terms of intact of certain types of advertising on the increase in
revenue
suddenly you find the put a t v slot and you found that because the t v
slot which you had suddenly people start enquiring about your car and you
asked a feed back on that then you that this t v slot has really helped
okay
and so that that is the kind of thing which i mean by  say saying the
analysis of impact
and also surveys of cus customer preferences in other words you try to look
at um um who prefers what type of car um you may go for um tata car or the
vofa maruti car and so on and you ask a question why you are doing this
and um one way of doing this is by saying out question as  to people
but no body answers questioners
because it's bore
you know you have to fill up the form and returning it so on
so some times you use you use a tactic of saying that well [21.52...]
you fill up a form and send it to us and i receive the form then you are
eligible for for a lottery which free free car and so on
so many body [22.06....] fill that form
but most people may not think after you have possibility of getting lottery
car is so little  that you may not worth you may not think it is worth
spending out time and doing that
so normally people what the you had to have a tactical method also of um
whether to use this form method or to send people to enquire from house to
house
but then people cost a lot of money to go and enquire
so this being determining the cost benefit of all these methods
and now what is the correlation between prices and sales
if i reduce the price is sales going up okay
or um should i sometimes what happens is if the price is made low people
think that it's a cheap product
they don't buy it
they go for a expensive one because they think an expensive product is
double quality
so there is also [23.11...] involved in this
so to pricing at the right level is an important tactical decision one has
to take
like for instance um um if you take um um say computer you are a you are
trying to manufacture computers in the market and sell computers in the
market
now um everybody talks about the sum ten thousand p c and so on okay [refer
slide time 23.39]
[pic]


so um is it really feasible to have that kind of a machine even the people
claim that sum ten thousand is now available
but the question is what do you get with that sum  ten thousand okay
and um is that machine um full fill all the requirements
so one has to also look at the um um look at the fact that by putting the
sum  ten thousand p c in the market as many sales  gone up okay
when it is gone up suddenly because of this lowering of price may be i can
make a nice product sof the margin of profit is small and get my money
through margin
there is the margin is small by by volume
huge volume is sold in a small margin to get a profit is quite high
very interesting example of this is what is as the tact to be followed by a
um um [24.43....]
  in olden days which came up with a compiler for pascal and um when they
came up with a compiler for pascal they sold it at forty nine dollars okay
we just considered a very low price
compared to compilers already in the market which are selling for thousands
of dollars
now when it is a forty nine dollars thing immediately people started to
looking at it
because first of all they are concerned may be it is not very [25.19....]
compiler
and started using it because the companies are giving sample copies
when you start using it and you found that is as good as any in the market
suddenly the market size increased and lot of people millions of copies are
sold and so even the margin on the each copy is small if you multiply a
million even five dollars per copy it becomes a huge amount
 and interestingly in software the cost is not linearly proportional to the
number of products products which are sold
what i mean by this is in a car there is a fixed cost for producing a car
and whenever you sell a car the price of the car must be higher than the
fixed cost of the car and that is the profit margin
in the case of a um software the fixed cost of fund that is the amount of
time you spend in developing the soft ware and the number of people who
have worked for it and so on
so all your money is already gone in terms of clearing that product
so now the larger you sell that cost is not going go up for you
whereas your profit is going to go up for each new product because the cost
of a new software is one one more copy of a software is cost of a c d and c
d cost no money at all
really speaking okay compared to cost of  that  software
so the marginal cost of selling extra soft ware is in terms of production
cost is almost zero
whereas the profit is is constant
so it can the profit can sky rocket if your volume goes up okay and that is
essentially what they found
and these are lessons learned by lot of software suppliers okay
they said that it is better to kind of price it at a reasonable level and
try to get volumes
and make your product good quality so they sell by itself and also the
method of giving something free as you so called a trial copy for something
like  a month
and a trial copy if you use for a month and feel satisfied then you pay for
it and keep it
other wise  i will kind of go away from your machine
so these are the kind of tact tactical methods which people follow
now the um other tactical thing one has to do is about how to deploy your
sales force
people have to um in many any product you had to have some other sales
do you really  have people  go around selling or [noise]
this advertising sufficient for selling
these are really issues they really have to look at in terms of the um
sales force
like in the case of for instance sale  of books the sales force this goes
to various book levels and college teachers and so on and tries to promote
the book
and um the sales force becomes very important to make the book known to the
public
and being available by producing it  in book store and so on
so where do i deploy this sales force
by deploying in north india or south india or east india or west india
for books for instance  many of many of the companies  deploy lot more
people in south india because the number of engineering colleges in south
india is huge compared to that of colleges in north india
so there is again in terms of decision how to deploy and what are the
alternate marketing channels
do they sell books by the web or by book stores and so on
and you have a special sales campaigns
um these are issues which tactics tactics are important [refer slide time
29.33]

[pic]

the operational information which is important in marketing management is
um as i said to feed the tactics in strategy
you look at the sales of the deployment as a tactical decision the
operational  decision to is to operational information required to take
this tactical decision is to find out sales analysis by regions which
customize which sales person sold and so on
and um the operational information is very important to be able to also
reward  a better sales person and so on
suppose a particular sales person in a area did extremely well what
normally companies do is to give some quotas to each sales person saying
that you are suppose to sale this much  and if they exceed that quota of
considered  amount then you have to give a bonus and um make make that
thing and make him give an  incentive
so that information should should be available to find out whether he
exceeded quota or he is below quota
if he is below quota of course you have to warn him and so on
so this is um the computer continuously computes or determines active of
sales who is sales person in charge and so you have a table which is
operational information
and you then you give a exceptional report based on table giving the people
who have exceed the target buy considerable amount and by the tactical
people may have to tell you anything which exceeds twenty percent of the
base amount you let me now
or if it is below ten percent of the base amount you let me know
if it is below ten percent that means the guy is not doing too well
above twenty percent means he is doing extremely well
so then i can take corrective action
the person is just going straight ahead and keeping up his quota and they
don't inform at all at the at the tactical level
so the guy continues and that is the kind of thing which because i i  don't
require i shouldn't have too much of information
so um the um similarly um the question of market share and trends there is
the what is the what the market share is again computed by looking at the
how the other competitors what their total market how much did they sell
and then this information is detailed information on how much they sold in
delhi how much they sold in chandigarh how much they sold in um um chennai
how much they sold in hyderabad and so on
the whole um um lot  of um data is available as at the operational level
and this data has got to be digested to at the tactics [refer slide time
32.51]
and operational information has seasonal variations where we are we are
selling gold jewelery  for instance gold jewelry is always a variation in
festival season like deepavali um there is a lot more sales of gold than
the other parts of the year and in south india during some thing like
sankaranthi there is lot more sale or during new years yugadhi  or
something there is lot more sales
so all these things you have to look at the variations and that is
essentially done by collecting the data
and um when you change a model of a car say maruti for instance when you
rent from eight hundred to something else okay and um was there a [33.45..]
change in the demand  for that car
that again is a detailed information and one has to analyze that and um how
how your sales outlet doing
or the how are they performing is the way in detailed information and one
has to digest it and cost of the campaign what exactly the campaign cost
and how how much is the benefit [refer slide time 34.08]

[pic]

so these are the things in terms of um what i would say lots of details
which has to kind of get digested
materials management is really how to um manage the um requirements of the
materials for the organization
like if you are a car maker then you require a lot of materials like on a
sense you require a seats of a car you require um steering wheels you
require horn you require tyres you require um um um lights head lights any
how [34.51...] items okay
and so with the [34.56..]
items which are there you have to decide on whether what kind of
development should i offer when they like
you know it is not possible for every car company to make all their
materials in internally
like suppose you want to make a um say a horn in your  car [refer slide
time 35.18]

[pic]

in your car company a horn is a low cost item but is a crucial item
and um you it may not worth your um while to do that because your labor
cost may be very high and it may not be worth really um putting that if the
quality is good
so you may take a strategic decision that horns are important
but i don't want  a kind of a invest a lot of money in that and um um break
all these things
so why don't i develop a vendor or a supplier i get over a small scale
person in the near by area and depend [36.03...]
 tell him look here i have a requirement for um fifty thousand um every two
or three months but can you make the fifty thousand horns and also giving
the know how to make it
because the small scale person may not have  to know how and train him
today that and so on and then you develop that vendor
once he becomes a good vendor then your head ache is removed
that is he makes good horns for you apart to your specification
 also the horn maker tries to find sells this that horn to other company ma
companies also and then he will try similar advantage because of if your
volume goes up then this cost will go down and new also get the benefit
so vendor  development for critical items is an important part of any um um
any new materials management
um similarly you know the development of for a for a publishing company
developing a um where  a paper vendor
so saying i i require this quality of paper so can you produce that quality
of paper
and essentially trying to develop that person
and another important strategic decision is what the optimal level of my
inventory
in other words  suppose i buy horns in a for my car [noise]
and expect there is about i will say fifty thousand cars
do i buy fifty thousand horns ahead of time and if i don't sell fifty
thousand cars and sell only thirty thousand i will be [noise] holding
twenty thousand horns for which i have paid and i am not getting any any
result
so that is very bad thing to do
in fact many of the japanese companies their major method is to so called
just in time manufacturing
that is they don't keep any thing at all buffer in their company or
inventory in their company
they expect the vendor to supply the item as if when required which there
is in  specified time
that i say within eight hours i require this item they should be ready to
sell it
sell it to you
this is possible in many areas where the liability of the entire system is
very good in terms of transport in terms of general situation and so on
is some what like that you know normally let me say very homely example
suppose you know that in your house if there is  a twenty four hours of
water coming continuously  and water is never fails
whenever you open the tape the water comes
then what will you do
you never fill the buckets in your house or you will not have  a sump or
over head tanks and things like that
so as you open the tape you can be assured that the water will come
that is called just in time water
when you require it the water comes
but if it turned out the supply is  irregular for various reasons two days
only you get once in two days when you get the water
then what you do
fill up all the buckets enough for two days and this i would say in some
sense waste one
because you may not use all the water
but you you want to be error on the wrong side because you don't want to be
kept caught got without water
so you will ove over stock water
same thing in a in a country suppose transport system is not very reliable
a lot of delay in transporting the items then i have to make a buffer stock
or inventory to carry out for that transport delay
and also for unforcing disruptions like strikes bandhs and things like that
which are not normally common things like bandhs are not common in
countries like japan
so they don't have to worry about this law inventory
many of the indian companies are forced to keep the conventry because of
this problem okay
then that is strategic decision
how much do you keep
how reliable is your is your system going to be and so on
determining proportions of materials needed i mean um and reducing
varieties of inventory in other words another important thing in terms of
proportion of material needed is also proportional items which i
specifically look look out for
has to look kind at with the some detail and reducing variety is extremely
important
in other words the more the variety the more the um um the different types
of inventory i have to keep
in fact one of the interesting thing which  strategy which every one use to
adopt
even today many computer manufacturers adopt is that they fully load up a
machine and then they remove some features some soft ware and give it to
you
because the varieties only one variety is there and then you order more the
more things then they will enable that part
like in order to use a have electric  type writer  which could supply which
could type both greek letters and english letters and the design is such
that both greek and english letters is possible
so when you did not ask for greek [42.33....] but the machine
[42.35....]was greek part  in the machine and some body wanted the greek
part  they enable that part
because  as you know many of these machines are now a days grew into  soft
ware and you can do that
 so it is redu reducing variety in terms of the profitability [refer slide
time 42.50]

[pic]

is better because you only make one type
now tactical information in material management is in terms of a um of the
um as i said the you develop the  vendors
and in developing a vendor you know [43.14..] vendor
there is a [43.18....]vendor then you have to after some time you start
asking for whatever price with which you can pay
so you really have to have multiple vendor development
 the strategy may be too in fact have more than one vendor developed and
tactics will be how many developed vendor
how do i make up my orders among these three based on their performance
so come up with performance measures
performance measures may be in terms of quality of what they are producing
responsiveness which the um the um made by request and um um in terms of
cost also
i mean are they the free free vendors one of them may cost more little bit
more
but his material may be much better quality
 so i have to have some method of measuring them
and also optimal reorder levels
optimal reorder levels what it really means is that when the inventory goes
below certain value at what value before will below which it goes do i
decide of  reordering
this essentially relocate the buffer
but in just in time inventory business then there is no question of
reordering level
reorder level is zero when ever you know i i get almost zero i ask by phone
to send the supplies
but if it is a situation when another [45.04...] supply for some reason
then you have to decide based on unavailability
let water in all two buckets or three buckets and so on depends upon your
consumption pattern and how quickly how how quickly can the new supply come
okay
and items you shop has a certain needs
what it means is that in a in a assembly shop which assembling cars is
assembling thousand cars a day you need four thousand tyres plus one spare
type spare tyre
now you have to have that four thousand tyres ready
but you may not put all those four thousand tyres in front of you
but you may submit in groups periodically determining the period and um
[noise] how to issue what is the standard deal in standard times in a
tactical decision [refer slide time 46.06]

[pic]

controlling the high value inventory
in fact one of the interesting things the most companies  do is what is
called a b c analysis
that is they look at the costing inventory item and divided upon three
groups
the a group which is a high cost item
b group is a medium cost item
c group is very low cost item you don't have to worry too much about it
about reorder level that's not critical
c level may be nuts and bolts
b level may be horns and um mirrors and so on
a level may be um gear boxes or um engine box which are very expensive
so i pay more attention to the high value inventory and not asking
[47.17...] to see
because they really matter too much to me
so when you concentrate on the high value items i in the long run i will
save lot more money
that is what is called controlling high value of inventory
determining impact on material cost and procurement with design changes and
new product information
in other words suppose i want to change the model of a car [refer slide
time 47.43]

[pic]

then to what extend will the old  old  items work
do i require new materials do you have to develop new vendors
how the cost of the materials will impact it
so these are things which one has to be concerned about whenever a model is
changed
and operation is of course as i said a lot of  detail in terms of  excess
and deficient items received from the vendor
list of items rejected because of their poor quality
but a critical items received so  i can immediately tell the manager who is
waiting for the critical item that is come you can start using it
so quickly the information has to circulate upstairs [refer slide time

stores in transit because mainly for some thing for  no dues and transit
i don't have to reorder many  in a big  hurry and i [48.45...] to come and
how much is already come is being inspected i can [48.50...] inspection if
i am running out of that material
so these are operational information which day to day [48.59..] in terms of
you know how the what i what i really mean by this is more the critical
item the exception report can go to the tactical manager saying that
critical item which you are really looking at
it is in inspection
so now he he has inspectors [49.24...] saying in a [49.25...] inspection
and other things do this first and send it back
so this operational information is important
value of inventory in hand what is inventory which is um um in the in my
hand so that i don't have too much of desk stocked
because too much of inventory in hand and it is too expensive then i am
loosing money because it is dead
the value has to be known to the um to the [50.05....] management
from day to day [noise] the value should be available
what are the goods received what are rejected and what is issued
these are all details which whenever some goods have come have or to have
um [50.27...] what is if rejected what is issued once iss it is taken into
stock then you have to inform the stores people that is ready to be taken
to the stock and once it goes to the store you have to tell the finance
people that money has to be paid because item has been taken into stock
so then he has to generate a cheque
this is operational information
daily these things have to happen as as when an item is taken into stock
and stored the payment has to be made
if the payment is delayed then you have a bad relations with vendor and so
later on he he start reducing on supplies stopping your supplies like that
so this operational information is very important [refer slide time 51.20]

finance is the next major item which you have to consider in some detail
because i said no company can really work without money and um
so strategy is in terms of how do i finance my my operation
as i said i gave an example of google
the financing at the beginning is a whole year of [51.58...] calculus money

that is some fellows gave me venture capital [noise] and i use that venture
 capital money to be able to finance my first year of operation
after that how do find out some method of  financing i have to get a
revenue stream
some income has to be generated
now the method of generating is an income is one the the interesting top
management strategy
but how much do you require to sustain the operation something which the
finance manager has to worry about
how do i price the another important part of any um any company
i gave an example of the the um pricing idea of um of Borland or pascal
compilers
similarly in india now what is the most important part one of the most
widely selling product is a accounting product called tally
so lot of people buy it for accounting
now those people has to decide what pricing should i do if this particular
product is got to be adapted by smaller shops [noise]
if i  if i decide that the if i tell the small shop keeper who has a
computer that to have  accounting package from me it is going to cost you
twelve thousand rupees he may say only computer itself cost fifteen
thousand rupees why should i pay twelve thousand rupees for software
that is the normal reaction of any person
so you have to look at is the pricing appropriate for the for the customer
to whom you are selling
so um strategy may be that if you want to sell lot more may be i make a
special dispensation in terms of kind of cutting down on on features like
[54.12...] and necessary features and give a bare bones or core [refer
slide time 54.17]

and price i say five hundred rupees or thousand rupees whatever and survive
of volume
so these are kind of pricing policies
tax planning you know tax planning means that every year as you know taxes
cannot be or inevitable
there is some body put it dead in taxes of true certainties in life and so
you have to pay your tax and you have to find methods of planning for that
in that certain companies what they really do is put their production in
some small state like pondichery or goa or some where where the taxation is
very low or they  sell make it there and sell it  to another state may be
the taxation is not is is lower
so you desire on where to do this you know and tax planning could be able
to get some profitability
the important point is that tax planning does not mean that you try to
cheat the government by not paying tax
that is that is wrong okay
this means is that you follow the rules in a game
rules of a game as decided by the budget and the government
within the rules of the game what is strategy of follow to reduce my impact
of taxes
so that is essential what is tax planning and tax planning is of course
there for both large company and even for individuals
one has to kind of have so called tax planning guides which are coming
reduce your overall taxation burden within within the rules okay
so these are the issues which one has to be concerned about the finance
management
and tactics in the middle level you normally come up with the budget every
year and you look at actually the what what  what budget should be there
how do budget for various things
in other words like if I am running a software company how much do you have
budget for buying new lap tops buying um desk tops how much do i allocate
for sales and marketing
how much i allocate for people going to work for me the human resource okay
so i look at all the expenses like human resource marketing cost the rental
for the place where i am going to have that soft ware company and have to
be concerned about that
in fact it turns out that certain areas like suppose you go to down town
that is nariman point in bombay the cost of ten square feet of area for a
small place for a soft ware engineer sit in work in front of his p c cost
more money for the company than his salary
so you may decide if there is no point you you  have to budget it
if you budget it you decide the budget is this much you go to nariman point

so you may  decide that it is not worth putting in  nariman point
the strategic decision may be taken to kind of shift it to out of a place
may be suburb where the rental is much lower and many people are even
happier to come to work there
or now the new trend is there is all internet white band and all that to
say um you don't have to travel to work
you work from home and you do always software development at home
and working from home is a gain some thing which is possible because of
soft ware
so you have to really look at that
in other words the finance management would say that if the cost of the
location is becoming important and i may decide to let my employees work
from home
but have a meeting place for all of them to meet say once in two once in
three days to assess progress look at other teams and things like that
so there are many items of tactics one has to follow and um if many
companies major problem is that they already sold the item but they have
not received the money
so you have to kind of track the track your bill of what you have received
and large large outstanding company has to take care of that  say
so the top management has to know what is last large outstanding payment
