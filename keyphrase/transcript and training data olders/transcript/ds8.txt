in today's class we will be talking about ordered dictionaries um [noise] 


1.16
and we also going to be look at binary search trees which is perhaps 1.21


one of the simplest ways way of implementing ordered dictionaries so what is an ordered dictionaries um
so it is essentially that you have dictionary functionality 




1.28
right so recall dictionary was that you have key elements pairs yeah and you use the to insert an element to search for an element or to delete an element 
besides that in an ordered dictionary you have the notion of the minimum the element with the minimum key element with maximum key and the notion of predecessor successor right okay
so when i say minimum key what that it means there is some kind of a total order of a keys right
this is different from when we are talked about hashing when we talked about dictionary if we recall we said the only operation that will ever need to know do on the keys is to compare to keys for equality 
given two keys we are to decide whether same or not 
so here we we are going to the 2.24




excepting more out of  our keys 
here we are going to assume there is some kind of a ordering relation of the keys so that given two keys i can either decide whether they are equal if they are not equal then i can say one is less than the other one is larger than the other yeah 
there is ordering relation keys [noise] um what are the parameters your saying to the function predecessor and successor 



2.50
have just shown s as the the ordered dictionary as one of the parameters need not be yeah 
so in particular you could think of a predecessor taking only one parameter [noise] which is a key 
so predecessor k would be give me the key which precedes k 3.07





in in the total order [noise] 
in the total order in the dictionary right 
[HINDI] certain keys in dictionaries s right 
so give me the one which precedes key k and which lies  in the dictionary [noise] exactly 
so keys are the elements 




3.34
the the particular field all the part of data which on the things are ordered right there is a total ordered on the keys 
so similarly successor function 3.44



3.45
 so what one way you can implement such a ordered dictionary 
so two trivals doing both cases we say using list kind of data structure 
so in unordered list would just keep all the elements in here
so all have shown here are the key yeah 
since it is unordered taking only constant amount of time searching will take ordered n time in the worst case because there is no order might i have to go through entire list before i found out the entire elements and deletion how much time deletion take order n because first we have to search for 4.18






element that we are trying to delete  yeah how much time would  successor take here [noise] order n not order one because 




4.33
suppose i say what is the successor of twelve in this in this dictionary 
successor of twelve is not twenty two it is fourteen right which is the key following twelve in the ordered relation 
so the ordered relation assuming just the the order on the integers yeah
so twelve is the smallest key fourteen is the key larger than that eighteen twenty two thirty four is the largest key in it 
yeah given twelve from twelve i have to given the key twelve i have to run through this entire thing to find out the one which was the smallest key larger than twelve yeah 
both successor and predecessor and min and max will all take order n time 
so fairly inefficient  implementation 
an ordered list on the other hand lets say we ordered the thing according to the total order of keys right 
so now minimum takes only constant time maximum also we can organize it takes constant time 
let say i have a pointer reference to the end in this list 5.36




yeah um successor also take constant time because given a particular node 




5.43
i can just go to next one will give me the successor say predecessor takes constant 
time 5.48





[noise] yeah of course so it depends upon how you given the node when i asked for successor if you have to search for the node then of course it will take order n time because you might have to go throw this entire list to reach that node yeah
but if i tell you where the node i gave you 




6.03
lets say reference to this particular node in this list
then you can compute the successor and predecessor in constant time right 
inserting also takes n times because you have to find out way to insert [HINDI] right
you have to find out the correction position for insertion 
okay searching takes n order time because again we may be the run through the entire thing 
if we use an array searching can improve right 
see an example we seen how to do this6.31




6.33
we use binary search to do that right
if you put the elements they are ordered put them in an array then we can do binary search to find out the element logarithmic time log in time right but binary search [HINDI] if we do binary search then 	 now insertion and deletion still take order n time right 
while we can find out what is the right place to insert 6.54





an element will have to shift all the elements to the right yeah so it takes lot of time to do insertion 
similarly for deletion we know where the element is which we trying to delete the we have to shift everything to the left yeah 
every one follows this okay this is just had




7.15
to recap what binary search so you remember binary search to search for twenty two you go to middle element twenty two is larger the right twenty five smaller go to the left so on and on 
and in that manner you will eventually end up with the array location which has twenty two or an array location  which does not have twenty two inch away case able to say whether twenty two  is their or not there 7.42






and the number of comparisons you would take in the process only logarithmic because 




7.49
well at each point make a every time make a comparison size of the array which you making the search halves so you the number of time you halve n to get down in to one  only log of n and so you will take order log n time to do the searching as to recall insertion and deletion i say that will take order n time 
any questions still this point this was the trivial way trivial's way to adopt 8.10








to implement a ordered dictionary 
right but we are not here to talk about trivialities 
so we are going to look at something more interesting right
that's called a binary search right what is the binary search binary search tree is a binary tree which has search property 




8.32
right recall what is the binary tree 
binary tree is a tree in which every node has at most two  children right 
a node can have one child two child or no children no children means it is a leaf node and now there is a search property that we are talking out 
so each node is going to contain a key and element 
in most of the following in that discussion follows not about talking about the element at all
we are just interested in the keys 8.58






so what is shown here written on the nodes are the keys right 
now what is binary search property 




9.05
the binary search property says the following 
all the keys which are less than five 
will be in the left sub tree all keys which are larger than five will be in the right sub tree and this property holds at every node not just at the root node [HINDI] right sub tree which have keys larger than three 
not all keys which are larger than three of course there are keys larger than three here but basically if i look at the left sub tree all the keys in the left sub tree will be less than this node 
all the keys in the right sub tree will be larger than this node 
similarly for this tree 
all the keys in the right sub tree as you can see are larger than this key value 
all the keys in the left sub tree there is no left sub tree nothing to talk about here 
if i look at this node all keys in the left sub tree are less than seven all keys in the right sub tree larger than seven right this is called search property 10.05





a binary tree in which the nodes have keys which satisfies property so the search properties is satisfied is called a binary search 
okay

is that clear
so binary tree plus search property equals binary search tree 
so 




10.26
if i have these set of keys two three five five seven eight then i can 
this is the binary search tree  with this keys in it
this is also another binary search tree with the same set of keys 
you can have many different kinds of trees with the same set of keys 
both of them are binary search tree because they both are binary satisfy the search property [noise] 10.54






it is implementation right 
so keys stored left sub tree of v less than or equal to k 
now you have to somewhere put okay 
so there are couple of features here 
here i am assuming that you might have keys which are also two keys which two keys which are the same right
so quite often this doesn't happen very often 
so quite often you would be using dictionaries only in settings were the keys are unique 	 right 
an element has a unique key 
no two keys are the same 
but suppose you had the setting were two keys could be the same right can happen right 
suppose your key was your name 
name of a student right 
you can define total order names let say geographic order alphabetic order and then two names could be the same so you could have settings in which keys are the two keys are the same 
now then we have to [noise] put um you know 



11.54
then we have to decide whether if a key is equal whether it should go to the left sub tree or it should go to the right sub tree and we can decide one way or other lets say we say to the left 
we could easily have said it goes to the right  yeah
there is no problem with that 
um 
here i am actually permitting it goes to both ways 
either go to the left or go to the right 
any problem 12.25



so don't okay so for the rest of the discussion let me just assume the keys are unique right
otherwise it necessarily complicate matters 
so we ill just assume keys are unique do other entire discussion see if there is any need of duplicate key is what should we do then right 
if there are duplicate keys what how do you handle that 
suppose you want to search in a binary search right





12.51
given a particular key 
so after all dictionary we are implementing dictionary
so given a particular key i want to find out where the element is okay 
so let me first show an example 12.59




13.00
suppose i want to search which this is my tree and i want to search for eleven right 
i come to the root  i compare eleven to the key setting here which is five right
eleven is larger than five 
so search property says that eleven has to be in the right sub tree yeah
that was the search property keys which are larger than the here will be in the right keys which are smaller will be in the left 
so wee go to the right sub tree [HINDI] this eleven is larger than ten 
so once again if it is there at all tree it has to be there in the right sub tree hence we go the right sub tree and we go to the right sub tree we compare eleven then with this we find eleven here 
so we are done 
we found eleven 
yes  [noise] 13.52




13.54
that was being said here to find an element key k in a tree T 
this is the tree 
you are given a key k ill compare key k with the root with the key in the root 
if k is less than k root then you search for the key in the left sub tree 
otherwise you will search k in the right
okay 14.21



14.23
suppose same example but now searching for six 
so we come here six is larger 
so we go right okay 
then wee compare six to ten 
six with ten 
six is smaller 
so we go left 
then we compare six with seven 
six is smaller 
so we try to go left 
but the left child id null 
so its not there 14.51


because if it were there it has to be here 
it has to be in the right sub tree of this guy 



14.56
because six is larger than five it has to be in the left sub tree this guy because its less than ten 
it has to be in the left sub tree of seven it is less than six less than seven 
so if six were their to be here and since it is not here its not there 
any questions [noise] 15.24





so sorry lets see what you are trying to say just once again what what's your question 
no question [noise]
okay good
so we can write the binary search this search procedure binary search tree either as a recursive procedure its an iterative procedure right
so the the recursive procedure perhaps the simplest to understand 
so you are searching for 





16.20
key k in a tree t right 
so you look at the root  of T 
lets say that its x 
if x equals nil which means there is no root empty tree then you essentially saying that nothing is their 
so just forget this for now 
if the key in this node x when this root node x 
is equal to one you searching for  then you just return the root node 
if it is less than the key in the root node if k is less than the key in the root node then you have to recursively search in the left sub tree 
so your are searching in the left sub tree of x 
and what you are searching for searching for k yes [noise] 17.44



okay what is the left of x doing okay
this is all pseudo code 
so please don't 



17.48
try to [noise] left of x let me come to what your question is 
x is a reference to a particular node right 
so x begin with refers to the root of the tree and then left of x is the is a reference to a left sub tree now to the root of the left sub tree 18.04






right so its referring to that and we searching for k in there okay 
so that's what we have to do 
and if key is larger than key in the node then have to search for k in the right sub tree okay
this si clear with every one 
okay  good 
lets go to the iterative version 
the iterative version we are not going to make recursive calls to the search for procedure
what we are going to do is
just we are going to do  in as we are doing in the search we are just going keep matching down the same tree right 
we start with x 




18.35
referring to the root of the tree well if x is nil which means it's a empty tree 
and k is not the key in the root 
then we ill do something what we ill do 
if k is less than the key then we have to go left right
so x now becomes the left child 
so x now gets the value of the left child of this current node 19.00



[noise] 
is it define differently [noise] 
okay yeah may be 
right 
we started of with x 








referring to this guy and then we said if k 
so suppose there is key k one here with searching for 
the key k if k is less than k one then we go left 
if k is more than k one we go right 
yeah 
since we go left here we are now continuing the search here 
so x is getting 	new value which is either x dot left child either you want to call this way right or actually code just showed you now i have written it as x gets left x right 
pseudo code i can use any one of these so this is what it gets and we continue this search
we are basically may be the next step we go right so on and on till we reach here 
this is were our node 
so will keep getting modified first it will pointing to this node then its pointing to this node pointing to this node and eventually pointing to this node right keep getting modified right (board time 21.02)





how much search take [noise] right 
so if 
so lets look at the iterative version of the [noise] search right what we did was that with each 



21.15
each time we went through this while loop which is right here we came down one level in the tree 
we went from a node to one of its children node child nodes either the left child of the node or the right child of the node [HINDI] we can came down one level right 21.33




we started a level zero which is the root then we came after 


21.37
one run of while loop we came to one level after that we came to level two level three so on 
so 
how many times this while loop executed the maximum number of levels in the tree and what is a maximum number of levels in a tree so the height of the tree right 
so the height if the height of the tree is h then the running time of procedure is no more than h 
so order h is the running time of procedure 
everyone understand this simple 22.02




okay now h recall can be very large 
i might have a tree on n nodes whose height is order n yes and 
‘


22.20
we will come we ill see what kind of situations happens but note that the height of the tree could be very large 
the search time is only order h the height of the tree order the height of the tree but the height of the tree particular can be has large has the number of nodes in the tree 22.45




22.48
let look lets look at other procedure that of finding the minimum element in the tree right 22.58



how does where does minimum element in a binary search tree [noise] why left most tree 
left most leaf left most leaf [noise]left most node or left most tree [noise] left most leaf okay lets see why that wrong 





suppose i have a tree which looks like the following [noise] 
okay i need to put up in a so its look like a binary search tree 
so lets put in seven five six twelve thirteen eleven ten 
this is the binary search tree yeah okay 
this is the smallest node
