okay so this is an introductory course on computer graphics (Refer Slide time 1:04 min)



where we will deal with some basic and fundamental principles of computer graphics so as says my name is prem kalra the best way to contact me is through the email address which is there and you can contact me from anywhere there okay so let us try to see the administration of this course so as we know that (Refer Slide time 1:40 min)


this is in a slot J monday wednesday thusday at tweleve so as for as the evaluation are concerned its going to be based on exams there we have two minor exams let say between thirty to thirty five percent of the rate and a major exam which may be of thirty percent right and then we have projects or programming assignments three to four right you will have thirty five to fourty percentage of the weightage so as i tell every one that this is the most essential components of the course you must do the assignments if you learn the course properly okay so this is the TA who is going to see the demonstration of your assignment and this is the webpage of the course so in case any announcement or the slides for the course are available on this websites okay so let see now the books and the material this is going to be used (Refer Slide time 3:04 min)


	
so most of these are sort of reference materials so i will be referring to collection of this books and material and you see here that this book by foley van dam thus and the computer graphics book book by hearn and beaker there are in international edition right so the cost of this books are not so high so if one wants to buy a book which contains most of the syllabus you are going to cover can buy one of this right and this are available in international edition therefore referable and this are other books from where we will pick some materials okay again i said that all this is available on the webpage okay so lets look at the broad (Refer Slide time 4:00 min)



overview of the contents which we are going to talk about this course so first of all we are going to look at some introduction and preliminaries computer graphics see also motivation of why one should study computer graphics what are the applications of computer graphics then we will talk about what we referred to us raster graphics so raster graphics basically is required because when we want to look at the most of the displayed wise these days they are nothing but collection of raster points which are pixels so one needs to have this display in this devices so what does it take to have the display of such devices involve certain techniques to be followed and which we studied in raster graphics then there is concept of clipping right so clipping is basically something which is to identify what is of interest and what is contained in a zone which is of interest for display 

right so you clip entities or primitives according to the reason of interest you have for the display then we are going to look at transformation transformations we must have seen this transformations the transformations like rotations scaling like this are known transformations so how this transformations are used in the context of computer graphics okay and this are going to be both two d and three d transformations then we are going to talk about some of the representation schemes and the way to do modeling right so curves and surfaces are basically methods which are representation which give us indication how can be model objects okay then we have rendering which is how do we display the models and then possible looking at the movements of those models that is what kept capsodent animation okay so this is the broad let say content we have okay so if you look at see the definition of those programs so you understand may be by seeing many examples of computer graphics what it could be possible right but just let say if we want to see as a as a definition  (Refer Slide time 6:54 min)



and then  it could be a basically a way to use computer to define to store to manipulate to interrogate and present that is display pictorial output okay these are some of the essential functionality we have which we are address in computer graphics okay and the the motivation is to have a pictorial output is as we all know that the picture is ten thousand worth words right if you are want to narrate a story or a scene or a situation then if you give a picture then you have dont want to write so many things about it right so the scope of applications is in all different disciplines we have right we have application in industry we have application in art and entertainment we have also have application in education medicine and so on so the scope is very very wide okay now so the basic elements if we look at the way we have define the contents of the course (Refer Slide time 8:19 min)


right may be we can again look at the broad three elements in computer graphics what are this these are modeling where we try to define the shape of the object and what do you mean by shape is basically the geometry of the object or the seem right so what are the different representation we required in which we can have the shape of all the geometry of an object thats what modeling is all about then we are looking at rendering rendering as i said is a way to display objects which in turn includes not only to decide what is to display right but also the attributes of display right for this we are going to talk about shading of an object right illumination of the object what is the color of the object or the texture of the object right so all this attributes also have to be incorporated when we are talking about rendering  okay because one of the one of the motivation we have is to be able to do the rendering as realistic as possible okay and then the third element on the component which is as i said is animation where we are addressing the issues of moments and dynamics okay this could be moments and dynamics objects of the same this could be moments or dynamics of other parts of seem for instance camera moment thats also gives  in motion of moments of  the seem okay or may be change of the attributes in the rendering that also will give you the motion of the animation right it is basically evaluation over time of the seem right okay so these are some examples of modeling (Refer Slide time 10:43 min)



for instance so we have a example let say this is some engineering part where we have collection of primitives there is a disk there is some cylinder there and there are other simple primitives so its an assembly of primitives together okay and then there are operations which could have union on them right so fraction of them and so on this is one way of dealing with modeling so assembling of primitives and operations of this primitives okay now there could be situation where we want to have models of structures which are not sure regular as we find in engineering applications right for instance a face fairly irregular structure then the question come how do we represent so one way to have a representation could be have a collection of point and the connectivity of this point okay which we call it as mesh right so so it is through mesh and this is showing that you can have a notion of sampling of this point from the resolution in which is specified the mesh here you see a dense measure and here you see a course mesh okay and that governs let say the faithful reconstruction which you have for the face right so there could be instance there this is better suited where there could be instances there this is better suited okay then there are also structures where we need to have a continues representation of the geometry right so here when you see a structure like this what we have is the continues surface more or less okay so there are ways in which we have definition of surfaces which would agree a to the continuity criteria we prescribed 

okay so for as the parametric surfaces you may have heard the name this v plane surfaces so v is fall in to this category so we are going to look at those also and there are structures which we have of this kind  right so here what we have is there is a structure something like which is spherical in nature then this are this some multiplex to that structures okay so we can also look at this as a definition of a function define on a spherical domain okay right so we have implicit representation of a surface through this functions so we this are called implicit surfaces okay so there is a range in which we can have the representation for the geometry of object okay and this is to tell you that all you are concerned here is the envelope of the object right we are not talking the inside volumetric representation right this is just the envelope rendering if you look at (Refer Slide time 14:35 min)



so this is an example where we have a rendering of the wordsworth theem with chair and so on now this is just to illustrate that what are the issues involve so what you see that within this scene we have dichotic camera and this is the plain on which we project what ever is seen on this camera right so what are we saying we saying that there is an issue of viewing what we have seen in this screen through this camera which is define for the seem right therefore there are issues to what gets clubbed with in the custom of this view which is defined through the camera and then there also issues is how do i render this object what is the shading i have that is the interaction of the light source which i have in the scene right things like shadows okay this are all the rendering issues we have so here we see whatever is there of the scene this is effect to this camera so this sort of stimulate the process of rendering and then you see on the walls we have this pattern which is which is some sort of texture to the wall right the texture mapping on the wall okay now next this is favorite example i have is that look at this three images (Refer Slide time 16:27 min)



right as i said that we always try to attempt when we doing rendering to have a high degree of realism okay now if you look at this three images the question is which one of them is the real image this one fine but the other images are not too bad okay if i have probably not shown you this you would not made the difference so right all it is saying is that the rendering using various attributes in aspect we have one can achieve the quality of rendering as good as as close as to the realistic rendering we have right yah of course there are there are differences there are light differences there are texture differences right there are differences okay so this is an inspiration that we have a real image here and i want to try to stimulate this through computer graphics technology right now this is an example of animation and here which what we are trying to show is that this cartoon shape what you see (Refer Slide time 18:00 min)



you see will do some moments and so this is done here in the vision graphics lab so you can also see from the webpage we have so let me run this right so here in fact there a several thing which you might have observed that there was a motion of the camera there was a motion of the character right moving hand arms so on right and all those things are put together okay so there are several question is to when i need to do this animation of this character let say right so i need to have a represented representation in such a way that i can perform the animation so when you look at the structure it is an articulator structure meanings that there are joints there segments right which i can move and in turn i can move the envelope of this character which i see it has outside the skin right in association with my articulator circuit which i have inside so there are several ways in which we can do this okay so now lets go back and see the historical perspective ( Refer Slide time 19:37 min)



of computer graphics so if you see a in 1963 thats where we get the first graphics workstation okay so it enabled to have the graphical output on the monitor okay that way you start and then the first siggraph which is very popular event in computer graphics community this is special interest grow in graphics its an ACM conference which was held first in ninety sixty nine since then it has been held every year okay and then if you look at the activity which went in let say ninety seventies they where primarily concerning raster graphics shading illumination okay so rendering was quite emphasize it the trends continued even in let say late seventies and in early eighties right so the emphasize has been in the realism of the rendering and then in ninety eighties  particularly late ninety eighties there was a notion of  physically based animation so what does it mean is basically say that how do you eject the laws of physics to the process of moment and there are several situations where i observe

 if physical log eventing the moment right if i through a ball is a projectile motion and i know how to do a projectile motion right so there are many situation where we can incorporate laws of physics and do the animation that was the motivation the other aspects which we have is so now in ninety eighty nine what we had the first academy award given to a completely computer generated animation film which was tin toy by pixar pixar is a animation company which does the computer generated animations films and in ninety nineties the emphasize was given to the interaction scientific visualization virtual reality augmented reality multimedia and software so here in fact what we do you see is broadening of computer graphics many aspects started coming in right by the nature of computer graphics it is interdisciplinary in nature right but this was a more sort of emphasized in ninety nineties and in two thousand onwards we have real time visualization of large data seats right so what had happen is the concept of modeling which was more let say in the form of primitives and the representations for surfaces and so on in fact started depending largely on the acquition methods of data and geometry right so there i just put laser scans for acquiring the data what it gave in term is huge amount of data 

okay so then the issues where how do we cope up with this state now we have the way or we have the data which can capture the geometry but the data was showed dense then you have to have processes by which you can put on the data and use it in a meaningful manner right so issues like data compression they also kept right and also a some combination of computer vision and computer graphics right so so if you look at process of computer graphics what do we have we have input coming as the specification of the seem right we have the geometry of the model and so on output which  is on the device is an image right whereas computer vision classical  seen as i have an image may be more than a single image i have multiple images and i try to do the reconstruction of the scene or the model those images okay some what an inverse problem what we do in computer graphics so they could be several techniques which one can use from vision and from graphics and do some meaningful thing right so thats how the activity started in this area okay now this was just a historical perspective now let me also give you certain applications which are specific to the saying engineering so here what you see are various engineering parts (Refer Slide time 25:25 min) 



now this are helpful in a way that you can do lots of stimulations like instead of doing this experiments live with the actual parts you can do stimulations using this virtual parts right so that is the a way we can have the application of computer graphics in engineering similarly we also have applications in (Refer Slide time 25:54 min)



medical things like so here it is shown that what we can use in computer graphics as building tools which allow you the visualization of various parts or organs in human body right so there is a project called visible human project where you have enormous amount of data in digital form okay in slices and you can use that data to do three d reconstruction of parts right so this are the slices and this is the three d reconstruction from this part right okay and here what is sort of shown here you have this skeleton and some muscles which are on top of that skeleton and this is the envelope which is like a skinner this arm right and then you can add functional attributes to this in addition to the geometry we have reconstructed and again perform the biomechanical stimulations like what happens if i move this skeleton how does the muscle deform how does the skin change and so on right so we can use computer graphics in the domain of medicine so this is so this is a gross level of body structure we have and these are the minute structures we have for instance tooth right and we can look at the reconstruction of this so they can help us in the process of diagnosis of any of normality right visualize them okay this can be a good aid to the medical cleanation  okay so similarly one can see applications in biographics (Refer Slide time 27:55 min)



biographics meaning that when we are dealing with molecules and molecular structures right so we can have representation of various parts or atoms of a molecules and there connections or other functional aspects okay so and how does for instances protein represented right what are the linkages of protein to the rest of the structure and so on so one can also apply graphics in biology okay now entertainment of course this is sort of an obvious applications and we all (Refer Slide time 28:40 min)



see application of computer graphics and entertainment right so you might have seem several of this special effects which are done through computer graphics you might not have not noticed that it was done through computer graphics but you might have seen those special effect right so this is a you may already know what the example is this is from final fantasy so let me just run this and you can see that the amount of realism (Refer Slide time 29:12 min)



which has gone in so here again (Refer Slide time 29:28 min)




 the issue of the amount of data which is generated right (Refer Slide time 29:31 min)



the amount of resources which are used up for generating the frames is enormous so this is the completely virtually created character okay we still notice that is not a real person right but we can appreciate the realism which it has even now right okay now if i if i see a let say very gross picture of what we are talking about computer graphics i can look at basically this as rendering process right and (Refer Slide time 30:19 min)



i can have the definition of a three d scene which in tern gives me a two d image through this rendering process right so all i see is that the conversion of a scene into an image right lets try to look at the autonym of this process in much more elaborator way and see this processes with pipeline okay (Refer Slide time 30:57 min)



thats what it is and thats what we will be looking at that various stage in this course so what do we have we have just elaborated that conversion that we had three d scene to two d so i have a three d scene which in fact is constructed using various model right so i have model one two model n and i apply some transformations through a which i take let say model length one to this three d words right so an example could be let us say so i want to do the reconstruction of this room okay there are several chairs there people right and there are walls and so on a many things we have now what i can think of is that since chair is a single object right then i do not have to do the modeling of every chair if i find that the other chairs are just an instance of one chair right i have a model of one chair all i need to do is apply an appropriate transformation to that model right and put it in the three d world okay so this modeling transformation is basically taking from the coordinate system that i have specified for model to the coordinate system i have for the three d world right once i take a chair to the seem it does the transformation of this coordinates right

okay so and through that it enables me to specify instances of the same model i can have various modeling transformation attached to this model and put it in the scene right so once i have got this three d world built up as an assembling of various models using modeling transformation now i need to worry about how do i view them right so let us say there is a situation where iam setting thats where i put the camera right so once i have bet the scene by inserting the camera again gives me specification of how do i want to see that seem right so i again there is a notion of transformation which is for the viewing of the scene right because this seen going to be look differently if i see it from this point from that point from other point so right thats what we try to capture through viewing transformations viewing transformation in terms means that i specify this camera and the attribute of that camera into the scene so this transformation gives me another three d scene right which has the viewing specification okay now remember that the output is going to be the animation right so all this processes ultimately have to be map to be something in two dimension so there i need some mechanism by which i can project this three d scene on to something which is two dimensional right and since i have specific the viewing out of the camera i have a way to perform this projection  

okay here we are taking about how do i project this three d scene to get this two d scene okay now once i have got this two d scene this could be in the representation i had used to define the world right could be continues representation of object right now as i told you that ultimately that the two d image which we display is displayed on a raster device right which is nothing but collection of pixels then i need to have a process of rasterization where i will convert this representation whatever i obtain in the two d scene through this two d image okay this is how the whole pipeline is for converting my three d scene which i had to this two d image okay and each of this talks is we are going to study in detail right now another view of let say graphics more in terms of as a system so that was the process by which we had looked at now if i want to see it more as a system where i had the hardware which are used for the system i can see this as basically (Refer Slide time 36:45 min)



collection of some input devices right for reference keyboard mouse and so on a unit which has the capacity of processing and some memory unit right with does the journey and then i have this what i call it as frame buffer which is nothing but as for as the representation is concerned it is something like array of pixels right and what is the motivation of having this as i told you that output display is something like what we have for instance CRT monitor right thats what you are used to and these days we also have dft lcds display now the idea here is that this processing which have i do here need to be map to this output display through this frame buffer which is containing the information in something like raster forms right gridder points grid of pixels right which i will map it to the output display whatever i have okay so this frame buffer which we have is nothing but something like collection of grid of pixels where the resolutions the special resolution gets determined by the number of pixels i have want to display or i have and the depth is the number of bits i assigned for each pixel right this basically give me the capacity or the resolution of this frame buffer right or the memory space i need okay now lets try to see the the linkage which we want to established between this frame buffer in the output display okay and then later on we are going to look at the input devices what kind of input devices one we use okay (Refer Slide time 39:18 min)


so you are familiar with CRT display cathode ray tube you know how its works right more or less okay so what is happening is that these are some sort of deflection right we have and where is this phosphorous coating on this screen which basically gets on it off with that refresh it off sixty hertz right that is why we cant see the discontinuity right cannot able to visual preserve it with this right okay so what can actually look at this display devices into the category of raster scan display and the random access display right so raster scan is that iam basically doing a scan wise display right from the top to the bottom and random access is that i do a display in a calligraphic fashion so wherever it comes i just push that on right so again in the case of a raster scan display i have what we call it as non interlaced and interlaced right so non interlaced means i go every scan right one scan after the other one in interlaced i basically do a half scan first and then the other half and this half is decided by i do a first let say odd scans and then i do event scan so this may increase the effective rate of  refresh right and thats what is done in many of the monitors we have centralized  is there resolution also affected resolution is not really affected because as i said that the time which we are taking to do the display right very very short so right right so so but you know the the visual difference as for is concern it is not so much 

okay because iam going to see just one scan then the other scan so right so its a result of two scans eventually which gets to my impression right thats what gets aggregated when i perceive it right okay so now what we are looking at is some sort of an interface which takes as from (Refer Slide time 42:30 min)



the frame buffer right which is grid of pixels so the array of pixels and the CRT display right so this has been we know that it take the an analog kind of a device so now what are we trying to say that gate going to take some value of the point here which is the value for the pixel which you want to display and map it to this right now one can think of that the information where here we have there is a registered for the same number of bits i specified here for a point or a pixel right and i have a digital analog converter right which takes this value of this register and puts into the appropriate analog value i need for the change of the voltage of the whatever right for this fine so now what we are saying is that if i have the bit planes so the bit planes means the number of bits i specify per pixel from this frame buffer so the bit planes in terms gives me the range of the intensity value i can have right if i have n pit planes it means i can have this many intensity values zero to two to the power of  N minus one minus one should be here two to the power minus one right okay so now let us say i force this as a question that instead of having so what is happening is that the range of my intensity of the color i want to have in my CRT device gets completely determine by the number of bits i assigned per pixel in the frame buffer is in it
 
now let us say i want to argument this right that means though i have let say three bits three bit value here so i had a three bit register here right we should have given eight value but instead of a i want to have sixty but the range of the intensity right sometimes which i have as a four bit pixel value right  how do i argument that so one way is that what you can do what you heard the name look up tables right look up tables are good way of handling this what happens is that let us say (Refer Slide time 45:32 min)



this is the sinerio i have this frame buffer right where i take each of this bits right and i have a register here with three bit register so depending on the value of this register which earlier was getting map to the intensity value now i do something different so i define a lookup table for which i have clearly the width of this larger than the number of bits i have for the register right that is where i will do the augmentation right so what ever i do i use this value in this register just an a index to the table so i do not use this as a intensity value 

okay but i use this as index to the table and in that table i have the entry of the width of my choice right which is larger to the size of the frame buffer right so this way iam augmenting the intensity is in it the only limitation is what is the limitation i have right right so so what is he saying that simultaneously if want to look at i can still have those many color right i can have only eight colors right but the width of them on the values can range from zero to fifty if i have a four bit width of a look up table right but that may no be a big constrain you may still want to use limited number as for as the colors are concerned but what you want is the width to be more right what the number of bits of per pixel to be more right okay so a may be stop here so next time what we are going to look at is in the graphics system we had looked at right what are the input devices how do we look at the functionality of those input devices okay and then look at the entire rendering pipe line going from the end of it right so we will do the traversal of the pipe line in a reverse order right for instance studying the rasterisation process first okay alright thank you
