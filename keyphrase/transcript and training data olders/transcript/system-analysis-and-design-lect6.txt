last time we  were  comparing  on  line  transaction  processing  and  batch
processing
and we said what what situations we use  batch  processing  and  under  what
situations we use on line processing
the major difference  between  on  line  transaction  processing  and  batch
processing as i pointed out in on line transaction  processing  we  have  to
emphasize response type
while the person is being waiting some person is being serviced
so the response must be very fast
whereas in batch  processing  because  it  is  done  periodically  the  more
important criterion from the point of view of the  person  who  is  managing
the server is to get throughput
that is as many programs as possible in the given unit of  time  one  should
able to run
and this effectively reduces the ideal time of the computer
and reduce ideal time is what effectively  gives  you  might  say  the  best
performance for the cost of the machine which has been investing
there is lot of confusion in general in people's mind  between  what  is  on
line transaction processing and what is real time processing
it is in fact very often used synonymously
but it is not correct
you use real time processing and on line processing are synonymous
because in real time processing the primary aim is to  be  able  to  meet  a
certain dead line in finishing a particular task
if the dead line is missed then the task has to be aborted
that means it doesn't work properly
to give a simple example if you are actually controlling  the  motion  of  a
space vehicle you got to be able to give commands to space vehicle  in  real
time while it is moving
similarly if you are having a system to control the landing of an air  craft
the landing of air craft now a  days  in  fact  controlled  by  a  on  board
computer
and landing is a short period because of plane is  coming  at  a  very  fast
rate
so you have to be able to give correct commands  in  terms  of  height  what
height it should come what speed it should have for him to land correctly
if there is an error or if there is a delay particularly  if  a  delay  then
there could be a air crash
so in real time processing not building  the  dead  line  then  meaning  the
difference between  the life and death
so the actual constraints are requirements on  real  time  systems  is  much
more severe than on on line systems
on line systems doesn't really matters if the customer has to wait  for  one
extra minute
only thing is the customer will become little impatience
but doesn't really mean any life of  that kind of a problem
so online processing is some what similar than real time processing
another point one should realize is with the coming  of  personal  computers
in large numbers and with the coming of networks both both with  local  area
networks within organizations  and the internet  connecting  networks  local
networks world wide network of computers
such a system were more or less connected to every thing else  most  of  the
systems are really on line systems
primarily because the connection is available and on line system has  become
more or less very common and batch is used only  when  you  have  a  lot  of
[6.22...] for once in a while processing
for instance all enquiry systems are on line
if you want to do  any enquiry on your bank account or if you want  to  make
an enquiry about ticket status in a train or a bus all these things  are  on
line
not real time processing and whereas batch system always periodic
unless re emphasizing  the point that it is  periodic  the  periodicity  may
vary from depending upon that occasion
it can be once a month like pay roll it can be once a year like in c e t  or
it can be once a day at the end of a day  you try to find out  how  much  of
goods are sold say in a retail shop or how much of money  was  collected  at
the end of the day
so these are periodic
so periodicity depends upon the application [refer slide time 7.28]

now  we  have  been  talking  about  the  three  broad  classifications   of
information systems
we said that the routine data processing system is the  one  which  is  very
commonly used
and  then  management  information  systems  are  the  ones  which  pay  for
themselves in other words they  are  the  ones  which  leads  to  profit  in
organizations and decision support systems which are used by top  management
for strategic decision making
so the operational information comes from the data processing
tactical information comes from m i s or management information  system  and
strategic information comes from decision support systems
now if you look at um the m i s the input for m i s is always the output  of
the routine data processing
in other words routine data processing is necessary in order to be  able  to
do anything further with management information system
in the earlier days of computers when computer is slow and computer is  also
restricted to in terms of memory and so on  many  organizations  start  data
processing only with routine data processing
because the machines are not powerful enough to run  more  complex  programs
because of lot of memory and so on
and also data collection and data storage in the sixties and seventies  were
quite small
because the steric devices which are available in fact the  maximum  size  i
remember
[refer slide time 9.43]
[pic]

in the early seventies was only two megabytes
today no body talks about less than eighty giga bytes on a p c
so storage size have increased considerably now the cost is not gone up
and this is made it much more important to emphasize m i s  because  passing
power is no more a constraint
the only constraint is your own method of imagining coming up with a  proper
idea of working
the operational information as i said leads to the  raw  material  on  which
you can work to get the m i s or tactical decisions
let me take a very simple example
some years ago i was consulting for a truck company and  the  truck  company
they are proposing a lot of trucks as you know
that is what they do
and um they were actually also  keeping  records  of  how  many  trucks  are
produced every day and after the trucks are produced they also produce  some
spare parts for the trucks
because unless there are spare  parts  available  like  for  instance  shock
absorbers springs pistons and so on
spare parts become an essential part of the sale of a truck
if a truck company has a reputation that their  spare  parts  are  available
with no difficulty at all then the sales of the truck will increase
therefore they are all the fine that you bought a truck and you can't get  a
spare part easily then naturally the  people  prefer  the  truck  which  the
spare parts as well as the service centres are available in plenty
so in fact the most of the current companies have realized  that  and  there
are um um both workshops for repairing your cars trucks and so on
as well as the workshop stock a lot of spare parts
so the company found that  spare parts what some what they innovative had  a
idea of how much of spare parts are being consumed
the production was in a different time and is costing more money to produce
further apart from that in most of these areas  whether  it  be  motor  cars
trucks or even computers when you buy the product like computer or truck  or
motor car they try to sell you and keep the car very competitive  with   all
the competitors
but when it comes to spare parts there is where they make the money
the spare parts are the ones which are expensive and so  that  profitability
of spare parts is normally higher to the profitability of truck itself
so in that based on their operation data you are computing  the  probability
of spare parts versus profitability of trucks
they found that for the same amount of money invested spare parts is  giving
more profit
than trucks
so the question which immediately arose is that in order to make  sure  that
i don't run up with spare parts
if i run out of spare parts when it is  needed  by  workshop  then  spurious
spare parts will come into the market and  not  only  you  will  loose  your
money
but you will also loose your reputation
because various spare parts will not have the same strength or same  quality
of spare parts you produce
so one of the important things company have to do was a predict
and the prediction is based on what the past
[14.17...]  consumption  over  over  a  period  of  time  in   the   project
consumption
and say what the consumption will be at different periodic intervals
so they use an operation research technique which is primarily a  method  of
using mathematics do thins like prediction statistical study and so on
so they have a predict prediction on these  things  and  then  they  decided
that there is no point in having a separate time for making spare parts  why
not combine making the spare parts along with the making of  the  parts  for
the assembly line
in other words they effectively try to make some of  this  parts  which  are
made in in the company need those parts as  an  extra  set  along  with  the
production of the regular items which going to truck
so there is no separate requirement of schedule and so on
same schedule is used but you have larger number coming out
some of it goes to truck some of it goes to the spare parts
so this way they are able to optimize the  production  of  spare  parts  and
also not to overstock or under stock
let the correct level
so the probability of not having a spare part is made  low  and  effectively
the profitability really went up  is also calculated
what the profitability will be with [16.08..]
so to convince the management this is the right method of doing things  they
have to one all the simulations on the computer with  the  operational  data
real operational data you have collected over a  period  of  time  and  show
graphs and curves and so on to the managers to convince them
so that is a good policy
the policy changes in a company take place because  of  the  fact  that  the
operational information has  used  effectively  to  improve  the  method  of
working of the company is one example
many many such example
one more example i would  um take is that of inventory
inventory control is one of major applications of  m  i  s   where  the  two
basic ideas in inventory control is you should be able to keep like  if  you
are running say a if you are running a store  of  a  food  mart  or  even  a
medical shop it is important to be able to not loose  to  customize  because
you didn't stock that item and you should not over stock
the over stock of course things are lost
things are in the shelf without making any money
that means you are loosing money on whatever you invested
so it's very important to be able to decide  or  the  volume  of  particular
product at which time you got to reorder
so when you go go that is called reorder point
that is you go on finding out the current stock position of some  particular
item and stock position is getting to a limit you reorder
and the amount of quantity you reordered depends very much on the as i  said
the the time taken to get the goods into a shop
other unforcing reasons and so on
and again o r or operation research techniques  are  used  based  on  passed
data to able to come up with a reasonable  reorder  point  and  the  reorder
quantity
so that over all the particular shop does not run out of  the  item  neither
to the over stock
so this is the primary aim
so these are the some typical examples of  the use of m i s
i think go on and on with examples but i made the point namely that the  raw
material is input
in input you have to correct the right input
you will correct the right input unless you know what where you looking  for

so it's all more to be important to  be  able  to  look  at  what  the  item
objectives are trying to get necessary data and operational sys  operational
information system
but m i s by in large is an very  important area of of application
and there are other decision support system is  one  level  beyond  that  is
done by the decision of top management and it is very  unstructured  and  it
is very difficult to obtain precise information because the fact that  as  i
said earlier many of these decisions are based  on  your  general  knowledge
and knowledge of the field what is going on and things like  that  and  also
depends upon the what kind of a stra strategy you want to take and you  have
to again use analytical and simulation models to be able to come up  with  a
reasonable decision support system [refer slide time 20.48]

[pic]



actually there are many aids which are used in decision support  systems  to
conceptualize the problem say graphs animations etcetera to understand  what
it is
and you  also  use  archival  data  to  infer  trends  and  there  are  some
artificial intelligence tools also we use what i mean  is  certain  kind  of
heuristic rules  are use which you work on based  on  your  assumption  that
this may take place
let me give a example of a what what this implies
very often in decision support systems you use a what if question
what is meant by what if question is suppose you have a choice [refer  slide
time 21.47]

[pic]

you are running a running a retail shop and you want to find out whether  it
is worth wise starting a another shop in a new area and  you  want  to  find
out what investment will be on that and what you expect to be  on return  of
investments whether starting this is going to be profitable or not
so what if question is if i start if i did not  start  it  will  some  other
competitors come there and start and i loose my potential customers
do start am  i going to profitable  right away or am i going  to  profitable
little later
is it better to prevent and do it earlier than your competitor does
so these are questions which are what are known as what if questions
and what if questions in fact regain by the use of very common tool  by  the
Microsoft office namely spread sheet
in spread sheet you have a number of rows and columns you  can  put  as  you
know formally we can change values around percentages around and so  on  and
instantly you find the effect of that
in other words you can use spread sheets to ask questions like if the  sales
goes up by this amount how much will be the profitability give up
or if you are warning the pricing policy pricing policy  is  very  important
like for instance book publisher publishes a book
at what price should he sell it [refer slide time 23.44]

[pic]

if he sells if he sells at a high cost may be the number of people  who  buy
may be small
but profitability will be quite large
but if it is a huge sales because  the  cost  is  reasonably  low  then  the
profit total amount of profit i have made because of the volume may be  very
high
so the pricing decisions of most products is crucial
in fact it is very interesting area and many companies  intentionally  price
their products very high  to  give  the  feeling  among  people  that  their
product is superior
it may not be at all
but then there is a certain small volume in thinking that I  bought  a  very
very expensive piece of an item
it may not have all that high quality
but it's again they are [24.48...] to a certain segment of  a  market  which
has money to throw away
so these are pricing decisions which the decision support system allows  you
to take in terms of getting a strategical idea of  what  is  the  population
which you are catering to
is there a population which is got disposal income high  income  which  they
can essentially spend on expensive items and so on
in fact one of the reasons why many of the  multi  national  comp  companies
sell multiple products likes shoes and bags are coming to india is  that  we
have now fairly large middle class of almost two hundred million people  who
have reasonably good disposal income  and  so  there  is  a  possibility  of
making some profit on this income
so that is another reason why they do that
another kind of a important tool used in decision support systems  and  also
in m i s is called data mining
what is data mining [refer slide time 26.19]
 [pic]



see we collect data over a large period of time routine data
now huge disc are available tera bytes worth of are disc available
so huge amount of data can be collected and stored and organized and  so  on
and
previously all that  so  called  archival  data  was  just  kept  for  legal
purposes
that means  over period  of  time  audit  will  come  and  check  your  what
happened to your company and they may try to look at the archival data
so it is primarily used as a  historical data
used only when some auditors come around and so on
that reason was in the earlier days many tapes are  available  for  archival
and tapes are painfully difficult to process because  sequentially  data  is
stored
whereas now terabytes can be stored on disc
that are so called disc network of storage devices giving you tera bytes  of
data [refer slide time 27.42]

[pic]

for disc you can access data in a much more easy way  through  indexing  and
so on
searching a disc and getting some actual processing based on the search  use
becomes feasible which is not feasible earlier
the data mining is coming coming in its own because of  this  huge  increase
in disc sizes
so you create some hypothetical use to guess  some  hypothetical  rules  and
try to see whether the rules are really valid or invalid
for instance a manager or a of a railway  system  may  know  too  experience
over years that the traffic on the certain routes is very high and there  is
also seasonal change in traffic pattern
if there is in some where the traffic goes up very much
in deepavali time it goes up in dussera time it goes up and so on
but to actually verify the operational data can be  found  out  to  see  how
much how many people are there  there in the waiting list
the huge waiting list that means always people wanted to go but they  didn't
go they couldn't go because non availability  of  seats  and  so  they  took
alternate transport
may be a bus they went  by or  if they are richer they went by by plane
so you have lost your [29.37...]
but this is when you hunch
so based on data mining they can  formulate  rules  saying  that  over  this
period the traffic is expected to this much and  compare  their  rules  with
the real fact based on data which is being collected and  the  rules  adhere
in fact kind of match then you know the rules can be used and you  can  take
an action like for an increase in number of sleeper  coaches  at  that  time
and so on
or you also can take other kind of decisions like recently what is  happened
is that many budget airlines has come  and  they  reduce  the  cost  of  air
tickets
they are trying to almost compete with the second a c two tier with trains
so railways got a little jerky saying that our  client   is  being  lost  to
compete in career
so two ways of solving this problem
one way of solving this problem is of course to reduce you a c  compartments
then you make a lot of profit on those
so there is no point in reducing
otherwise reduce the price
you have to some extend reduce the price
you try to make more people come and sometimes they find that in spite    of
reducing reduction of price based on  data  collected  in  with  operational
operational information system which is as  in  the  reservation  data  that
lots of berths are empty in second a c but there are big  waiting  list  for
sleeper
so what minister said as a strategic decision is that we upgrade the  people
who are kind of frequent traveler by train i would like  to  give  a  little
bonus and instead of that those going empty i upgrade  him  sending  him  to
the second a c and the empty seats in the sleeper can be  used  by  the  peo
people in the waiting list
so those empty means no money
but going with some costless means some some profit
so it also gives some good  feelings  among  travelers  that  is  frequently
traveled by train they get some bonus
so this kind of a strategic decision is taken based  on  data  collected  in
the recent past
if the same thing same question you ask to the railways five years ago  they
would say what what non sense you are talking off  because  every  thing  is
going full
only when the planes came and started competing then this problem arose
so the point is that strategic decisions improve the  profitability  and  it
is actually comes out of data mining and  some  of  tactical  decision  also
come out of data mining looking at what happened like the spare parts  as  i
pointed out inventory and so on and lot of  things  are  come  out  of  data
mining
so lot of what if questions what if the data is correct what if the data  is
lie [refer slide time 33.30]

[pic]

and and that can be kind of predicting
so this is about waiting list and  increasing  sleeper  i  gave  an  example
which is essentially [33.47...] transparency [refer slide time 33.49]

[pic]

the most interesting point is sometimes unexpected  results  come  out  from
the analysis of orthogonal data
something which comes out unexpected  that is  lot   more  valuable  because
you never have guessed  it
but it gave valuable information to you
so very often unexpected results do do lead to new marketing strategies  and

one interesting example of this is in  terms  of  the  data  marketing  data
which people collected over a period of time about the  demand  for  certain
types of consumer items in rural and semi urban areas where  people  do  not
have that much of disposable income
but they still as per to buy some of  these  new  items  like  shampoo  like
tooth paste and stuff like that
so the strategy taken was that make small sackets of shampoo or small  tubes
of tooth paste so that the one time expense is quite low  and  people  start
buying
once they buy if the volume is very high  the  profitability  will  go  very
high
this is an unexpected thing
in other words people are ignoring so called poor people
but the poor people have a lot of money to spend also
where if  given the opportunity to spend it
so this is the kind of unexpected result which  comes  out  of  analysis  of
archival data and also lot of marketing things as well as certain amount  of
strategic ideas
so in this module you have laid  the  ground  work  for  [refer  slide  time
36.02]

[pic]


the design of generally information systems for used by organizations
and i talked about various types of information  systems  and  functions  of
various   various   organi   functional   point   functional   division   of
organizations
so we have some kind of an overview now of what organizations are  like  how
do they function what kind of information are they looking for
in what what types of information can lead to  good  operation  as  well  as
good profit for the company
so these are very very important parts when you think about an  overview  of
the design
these transparencies are also available in  the  website  which  goes  along
with this course
so you don't have to really copy down these things
that is there in the website for you
and over and above this support material for this course  and  also  lot  of
examples  exercises  solved  examples  some  notes  some   multiple   choice
questions and so on and i will urge you go and look at the  website  and  go
through this material in the website preferably as you are listening to  the
lecture
but at least if not at the same time at least revise or go  later  and  look
at it so that you know you understand better lecture
or in fact it is preferable to kind of really before a before  you  come  to
the lecture
but i could say that no body does it
i mean no body would really ahead of time
they even reading after after they event is um  is  is  important  but  many
students do not do that because they only study at the end of  the  semester
exam time
but then if you want to really learn this subject you got continuously  also
look at the web try to solve the problems and and so on
that way you learn the subject
learning is lot more important than passing the examination okay any have
so the haven't finish the this module i am going on to the  next  module  as
the next module is about how to get into  the  methodology  of  designing  a
system
analyzing and designing a system
this is the core of this course
so the core core itself core itself named system analysis and design
so the core of the subject you are really starting now and  system  analysis
and design we are going to look at number of issues
first i will talk about so called steps in  the  life  cycle  of  a  systems
analysis and design
now the question is what what i really mean by life cycle
life cycle is a um a common terminology which is  used  in  books  and  soft
ware engineering as well as system analysis and design and m  i  s  and  all
that
all the books use this
and you may  you may wonder what is this terminology is  used
actually terminology is borrowed from in fact the  life  cycle  of  a  human
being
every every human being has certain stages in his life
there is a infancy there is a little there is a child hood part then you  go
to school then you go to high school and plus two
then you go to college
then you go to work and then you retire inevitably also you  will  also  die
okay
there are stages in the life of any person
similarly there are stages in a design of a system
there is also stages in the life of a system
no system is going to be alive for an indefinite period
just like human beings are mortal computer based systems are also mortal
the reason why computer based systems are mortal that means  what  is  meant
by mortal in this case is that working system which  is  being  working  for
some years they may decide to throw it away and to remove a system
and say the whole system is died
whole system will die when people find that its usefulness is no more there
and it may arise because of many  reasons  like  system  may  be  reasonably
alright
but to be implemented in computers which are completely  absolutes  and  you
can't get any replacement spare parts for it
so you are perforce required to up  date  your  computer  system  to  a  new
system and conconiquently [42.35..] also come up with a new system  analysis
cycle which is appropriate for  the  new  environment  hearing  by  the  new
system
i know many companies which  you  don't   want  to  do  this  change  namely
because of it is very expensive to change and also it's painful because  you
go again through all the bucks all the difficulties and so on
in fact one of my cousin who is working in america  she said that well i  am
working in a banking system they are still using p d p eleven
p d p eleven was machine which is build in  nineteen  may  be  late  sixties
early seventies is not made any more
then i asked why are why is the banks trying to use the same system
she said well top managers are quite comfortable with it  and  programs  are
running and you gain more  or work done any how
so the question they ask is if i am trying to invest more money am  i  going
to get some return and i have to go through a lot of pain in this changing
is it worth it
so these are points which one has to consider in the long run
by in large it turns out that the managers are conservative they say let  if
the thigs are working let it work
why not this why this term
and why why as i say why um wake up a sleeping dog okay
that is a little just go on routinely and unfortunately some of  the  things
which are routinely going on will not lead to a certain profitability
they be forced to change only when they certainly find that the  competition
is come up with better information system and they are able to carry out  to
the customers better making profit
so then they will be broken up from their slumber or you  know  their  sleep
and then it will come to their attention that is necessary  to  change  even
it is painful
the point is life cycle is a number of stages and each stage  certain  tasks
are performed as a system analyst [refer slide time 45.31]
[pic]



 the  reason  why  we  talk  about  the  life  cycle  is  because  designing
information system of an organization is a very complex job
it requires a lot of conversation with people determining  the  requirements
and so on
it's a very long run out job and very often it takes a  very  long  time  to
cover with a good system
so when ever you have a very complex  system  you  you  should  be  able  to
divide the complex system into smaller parts and designing parts  some  what
separately
in programming they call it modular designing
in other words you some people also use the term divide and  conquer  for  a
very complex problem is there divide it
divide it by smaller parts each one becomes simpler to solve
so i will be able to look at the smaller part and solve it better
so [46.55...] conquer or model a design you also should know what  to  break
it up
you can arbitrarily break it up
so the logical decisions hadn't looked at each step  when  you  divide  this
complex part the smaller parts must have a logical  beginning   and  logical
end and
so you should be able to say when the tape  has  been  started  when  it  is
ended and  [refer slide time 47.27]

[pic]

apart from the fact that the end the time at ends you have  to  be  able  to
say that whether it successfully ended and at the end of each step you  have
to access progress
that is in other words you gave a certain  amount  of  time  for  the  whole
project
you may given some thing like say four months to finish a project
and if you are [47.59...] you may given some earlier  some  time  chart  for
each each part and as soon as you finish that part you compare the time  you
have taken with the projected time and if the projected time is  much  lower
than the time you actually took that means a slippage in  the  schedule  you
have delayed some way you have to makeup
to be able to meet the ultimate dead line
so i may have to put more people on it or have to follow a different path
so in other words it is important to be able to asses progress periodically
otherwise you end up in a situation where dead lines are slipped every  body
becomes unhappy
they work a long hours  without really being very  productive  [refer  slide
time 48.56]
[pic]

so these things have to be prevented
and um the method which one has to follow also that when you use divide  and
conquer or divide a particular long process into small  processes  you  have
to assign people with special competence in that area
if it is a design stage where you are going to  design  people  have  design
competence in that area for instance if  you   are  doing  for  a  insurance
company if  the designer has done it for  other  insurance  companies  which
are similar then you assign that person to this
because he will take lesser time
his learning time will be lower
so he may be you have to assign correct people to the correct job  and  also
at the right time
in allocate of proper financial resources for each steps
so these steps are necessary to allocate resources that human and  financial
[refer slide time
[pic]



so we are going to look at nine different steps  in  in  this  analysis  and
these nine steps which i am going to use are not secret
what i mean by its not secret not every author will use nine steps
some use seven steps or even less
but in my  view  nine  steps  are  required  and  each  step  is  some  what
independent to the other step
when you design a system step by  step  and  go  along  some  of  soft  ware
engineering books called this kind of a design where you  step  by  step  by
step as a water fall model
it is not [51.08...] i mean what it really means is that you  have  step  by
step by step solution
if you finish one step then you go to next step
it is called water falls model because water falls  in  a  step  by  step  i
would say okay
whatever it is
that terminology has stuck
first time some time first when i first heard  the  term   turn  water  fall
model i don't know what it was
then i have to ask what it is and the guy said step by step
then why do you use the term water fall
that is essentially make simply superior because i have to ask coordinators
so it turns out to many other organ terms in computing are  invented  for  a
particular purpose and very often when these terms  are  used  [refer  slide
time 52.08]

lay people or even the people who are new to the  field  you  suddenly  feel
you don't know it
but actually the concepts are actually simple
now the fashionable thing they say your water fall model is  not  the  right
model
you need to have a spiral model
now what is it spiral model and how is it different  from  so  called  water
model
the whole idea is that if you go step by  step  and  don't  review  progress
[52.44...] step at the end if you come up with a mistake then  you  have  to
replace everything
so instead of that common sense dictates that as soon as i finish some  part
and second part i revisit the first part
i just don't go with  the third part
reusing the first part and see any modifications are required  in  part  one
or step one having done step two in order  to  be  able  to  do  step  three
better
so you asses progress you modify and you proceed
there is a certain certain kind of feed back at every step you are going  to
use and the feed backs essentially are you might say spiraling the one  step
to the other
of course you should not spiral for ever
you should you should kind of design when the spiral ends and go  from  step
to step
but by in large these are all organ people but generally the the  ideas  are
fairly simple in terms of what it really means
and so the if you look at this so called nine  steps  in  the  analysis  and
task perform in each step
the steps are requirement determination
i first talk about first three steps
i will go on to other steps in the following talks
once first type is called requirement determination
what is what is meant by requirement determination is that  when  i  when  a
company wants to have information system to improve their  operations  there
could be two types of situations on the en counted
one situation is en counted is that there is a new nursing  home  which  has
started and this nursing  home  wants  to  use  computer  to  improve  their
operations [refer slide time 55.12]

so start from scratch then you can go and talk to people over there and  try
to find out what their requirements are
and before that requiring determination means what what is it  they  require
it for
do they require it  for  admitting  patients  allocating  beds  or  do  they
require it for diagnosis okay
or do you require it for  to teaching  give give some kind of  the   lessons
of um the doctors who come there to up date them
so the requirements may vary
is it only allocation of beds or also you want to look at  the  pricing  how
should be charged
creating a bill billing customers things like that
so there are number of possible requirements among these you  have  to  find
out what is the important requirement which you have to determine
i will take an example i mean day to day example okay
you want to you suddenly if your family says let us go  and  build  a  house
okay
let us build a house because i have a plot some where
now the requirement determination is means [56.49..] build a house
should i really build a house of this type even though  i  have  a  plot  or
should i continue with where i am
because i am quite comfortable where i am
it may be in centre of town where my  plot may be way out somewhere
there is no transportation available
so the requirement determination face decide whether  to build the house  or
not the house or to build the house at the later stage
postponed the issue
so this kind of a thing company has also to take
that is why do just now why a computer based system for a  nursing  home  or
my operations are large enough to make it necessary to have machines  and  i
don't want to make the investment at this time okay
so the decision is that time is either to go with it or not with it
even if i go with it what aspect of it i go with it
that is the deterination
specification only after i determine
so i talk about specifications next time and talk about detail
specifications are extremely important in many if you have   to  any  design
particularly of information system
and so requirements specifications is still an art [refer slide time 58.25]

and we need to discuss it at fair length which i will do next time
