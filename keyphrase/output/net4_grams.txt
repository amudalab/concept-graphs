error control means
control means error
means error detection
error detection correction
talking about error
data is transmitted
changed or corrupted
due to noise
distortion or attenuation
things may happen
burst of noise
similarly the data
sending some data
assume that data
condition and error
errors do occur
bits were transmitted
kind of error
change has occurred
lot of noise
lot of data
kind of transmission
random errors change
errors change bits
change bits unpredictably
unpredictably each bit
changed these errors
caused by thermal

lead to race
advantages and disadvantages
disadvantages of protection
bit of restoration
protection is simple
require much extra
ring would sort
back in action
higher layer protocols
recover from single
single link faults
multiple link faults
kinds of funny
usage of resource
lot of resources
restoration and link
compute the path
resource is reserved
current actual situation
protocol for keeping
compute some root
reserve the path
restore the original
path is discovered
practical than path

find an alternative
disadvantages of restoration
recover from multiplex
multiplex element faults
protocol to exchange
find the current
situation and form
form the alternatives
usage of resources
requires extra process
set up path
path or reserve
comparison between protection
protection the resources
resources are reserved
restoration the resources
dynamically computed resource

uncoordinated users competing
carrier sensing carrier
sensing carrier sensing
carrier sensing means
strange at first
media for satellites
due to space
milliseconds space delay
channel is quiet
handle the mac
medium to find
pure aloha protocol
bit has collided
garbled and lost
detecting by listening
listening to broadcast
absence of acknowledgement
user waits random
waits random length
mentioned various collision
collision resolution algorithms
transmit new frame
transmitted the station
station is stuck
performance all frames
divided into equal
equal size slots
transmit one frame
receivers are synchronised
slot so nodes
start to transmit
beginning of slots
nodes are synchronized
nodes detect collision
making the slots
ready to transmit
node obtains fresh
obtains fresh frame
frame it transmits
frame to send
slot no collision
node can send
send new frame
retransmits the frame
slot with probability
nodes ? nodes
wanted to transmit
transmit they start
slot went empty
slot is empty
collision affected efficiency
slotted aloha pros
pros a single
single active node
rate of channel
transmitting one active
decentralized only slots
slots in nodes
efficiency ? efficiency
long run fraction
fraction of successful
frames to send
suppose n nodes
send each transmitting
probability that first
node has success
slot is equal
.hence this value
maximum theoretical efficiency
achieve in slotted
pure or unslotted
frame first arrives
immediately so collision
probability actually increases
increases a frame
takes one unit
things may collide
frame will overlap
node is equal
node transmits multiplied
letting n tend
efficiency for transmission
computer network developed
number of competing
competing lan technologies
technologies but today
dominate a lan
newly emerging wireless
emerging wireless part
lan nowadays people
people are talking
talking about ethernet

talk about ethernet
dominant data link
link layer technology
slide51 the multiple
multiple access scheme
scheme of ethernet
ethernet is csmacd
vary from system
system to system
means a network
network to network
bus we put
put two nodes
two extreme ends
extreme ends suppose
suppose now packet
suppose the propagating
packet for moving
signal at end
.so b starts
.so the collision
collision bus starts
bus starts transmitting
back the jam

newly emerging world
emerging world spot
metropolitan area network
network also ethernet
dominating data link
ethernet ? first
single communication channel
kind of medium
common physical organizations
organizations of ethernet
machines were connected
unlike the satellite
advancement the multiple
multiple access technique
technique of ethernet
small geographical area
machine are received
machine is received
give the destination
frame is meant
machines are supposed
so-called same collision
machines are sending
packets will collide
packet to send
bus the packet
travels both ways
copy the frame
compare the destination
receive the packets
i.e the mode
operation is broadcasting
address a packet
subset of machines
multicasting this mode
end of spectrum
multicast ; meaning
receivers in order
receivers can receive
give a special
kind of address
discussion on satellite
protocol called aloha
versions of aloha
data to send
pure aloha scheme
number of attempts
attempts per packet
gee of pure
maximum slotted aloha
considerably better performance
similar that means
means we broadcast
kind of aloha
local area network
sense the carrier
refrain from sending
sensing we discussed
discussed this earlier
sensing in satellites
long time back
lan the timeframes
medium and find
reduces the collision
doing carrier sensing
number of collisions
compared to pure
detect the collision
part the full
full mac protocol
dynamic channel allocation
channel allocation technology
moved to fast
collision and switched
access we improve
improve the performance
introduce carrier sensing
sensing each hosts
data being transmitted
hear any data
finishes an inter
inter frame gap
allowed to pass
host starts transmitting
transmitting its frame
propagation delay propagation
delay propagation delay
propagation delay means
means two nodes
entire packet transmission
naturally the distance
distance and propagation
role to play
suppose this node
node b starts
carrier to sense
started in terms
terms of absolute
starts its transmission
transmission is lost
probability of collision
probability will depend
frame to reach
takes a finite
listen before transmit
channel is sensed
persistent csma means
csma means retry
immediately when channel
channel becomes idle
csma that means
node is ready
gap and start
collision to subside
kind of instability
csma we call
call a strategy
strategy as pure
persist that means
ready to send
interval he generates
generates some random
numbers and decides
stations may sense
sense the channel
delay in case
case of collision
group of protocols
significant space delay
csma is good
csma and non-persistent
non-persistent csma non-persistent
csma non-persistent means
draw the throughput
throughput versus load
versus load curve
kind of curve
throughput will depend
low persistent csma
steeply like aloha
csma ; collision
collision is detected
transmissions are aborted
reducing channel wastage
detection is easy
easy in wired
measures signal strengths
strengths and compares
transmitted and received
detect a collision
complicated in wireless
discuss wireless lans
detection is difficult
dominant lan technology

listen and sense
sense an idle
transmit a message

detecting station broadcasts
broadcasts a collision
collision or jam
signal to alert
alert other stations
collision has occurred
occurred each transmission
station then waits
waits a random

adapter gets datagram
layer and creates
creates a frame
frame that means
means it adds
adds a header
header to create
create a frame
channel is idle
starts to transmit
transmit the frame
channel is busy
transmits the entire
frame without detecting
detecting another transmission
adapter is done
detects another transmission
transmission while transmitting
aborts the transmission
transmission and sends
sends a jam
forget about collision
collision that means
collision that collision
collision after sending
frame which collided
nearby started transmitting
collision to happen
enters an exponential
exponential back-off algorithm
network is busy
make the network
network less loaded
wait for longer
generate this random
exponentially increasing period
higher random number
chooses a random
returns to step
times it waits
jam signal makes
transmitters are aware
collision we send
send a jam
detects a collision
collision and backs
calculate the amount
