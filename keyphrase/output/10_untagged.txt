computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh department of computer science and engineering iit  kharagpur lecture # 10  refer start time 00  43  good day so ttoday  we will be speaking about  noise  fiber optic  noise  components  refer slide time  00  53 ? 00  56 min  and fiber optic communication as might of heard tthis lecture as well as the next couple of lectures will concentrate on fiber optic components we have looked at some of the physical  noise  layer components of  noise  fiber optic systems before  so we will quickly review that that so ssome of  noise  the stuff we will be talking about today is going to be common and then  from that point  we will take out take up wdm systems  details of how wavelength division multiplexing is done and how systems are  noise  handled in fiber optic domain tthe fiber optic domain happens to be very crucial because  noise  a lot of  noise  traffic in terms of volume  okmay be as much as forty to fifty percent 40 ? 50 %  actually follows  noise  goes through the fiber as days are going by and as more and more demand for bandwidth  noise  is coming up  fiber optics is becoming more and more important  noisesso we will be talking about fiber optic components today  noise   refer slide time  02  05  02  39 min  sso in fiber optic component  of course  the basic fiber is there ; we have already talked about it  so we will talk little bit more about this then we have light sources and receivers on twotwo ends because we know that in fiber optic  noise  cables  light is the carrier of information then we require these different components like amplifiers  couplers  modulators  multiplexers and switches sso we will look at these components one by one and tthen we will start our discussion on wavelength division multiplexing  noise   refer slide time  02  40 ? 03  34 min  sso optical fiber as was mentioned earlier is very pure and very transparent silica glass is used so aat a moderate dimension  the light is restricted to the fiber because of total internal reflection for ordinary light ; this is a multimode fiber ok mmf mmf is used in lans lans for low speeds or short distances so mmf mmf may be used in lans lans ; that is another kind of fiber bbut the multimode fiber happens to be the cheaper variety and this is used in lan lans  but this is good only for low speed wwhen ii say low speed ii mean comparatively low speed  ok for this say hundred mbps 100 mbps or hundred and fifty five mbps 155 mbps may be a low speed and by short distances may be couple of kilometers at  noise  the maximum  refer slide time  03  34  03  51 min  at a still smaller dimension  that part of the fiber that actually carries the signal ? if you remember our discussion about  the fibers in physical layer  we have shown some diagrams regarding the cross section of a fiber  so at the very core ? is a very thin strand of glass fiber tthis is surrounded by a cladding which is also made of glass ; actually we will not be able to see the actual part of the fiber  which is carrying the signal tthe surrounding is also made of glass and that is again coated or covered etc  by outer protection so if that strand happens to be even smaller  say 8 to 10 nanometer range  tthen it acts like a wave guide and a single mode of operations  refer slide time  04  39  05  10 min  wwe will not go in details of eelectro mmagnetics and wave guide propagation of optics to this fiber  but any ways  the support of the single mode of propagation is called single mode fiber smf is used for higher speed  so all these speeds of 2.5 gb/sec or 10 gb/sec etc  are possible on single mode fiber and it also goes over longer distance ok and nowadays  we have fibers which span across oceans we have fiber from one continent to another  which is really a marvel of engineering and technology  refer slide time  05  31  05  50 min  so these fibers are actually single mode fibers there are a few transmission windows like 1310 and 1550 nm bandwidth etc fifteen fifty nanometer 1550 nm window is preferred for long haul applications because it has less attenuation  wider window  and we can get very easily get good optical amplifiers in this range  refer slide time  05  50  06  30 min  so t,this is the diagram you have seen before  so you will see that at around fifteen fifty nanometer1550 nm range  we have some the  noise  kind of low attenuation  noise  ssimilarly,thirteen ten 1310 nm  noise  nanometeris another window  but this window is quite wide although it may not look very wide in this diagram  in actual practice  this is quite wide so this is the wider window and we get good optical amplifiers we will come back to this point when we discuss optical amplifiers  refer slide time  06  38  07  37 min  why do we require optical amplifiers  because there are losses in fiber,losses in fiber may be due to various reasons  one  of course  the main thing is absorption that is what we showed in the previous diagram ; it loses energy to the atom and absorbs some of the photons so we get lower magnitude or lower strength of the light signal  as we go to longer and longer distances then there is scattering of photons by the medium so there is rayleigh scattering  due to slight changes in the refractive index of glass ; then there is mie scattering due to imperfection of the cylindrical structure  it ? s made to rigorous specification  but it ? s never exact in the engineering world ? it can never be exact so we get all these different types of scattering  absorption  etc  leading to losses in fiber  refer slide time  07  39  07  53 min  apart from these just lowering of signal strength  one problem is that the losses are in nonuniform for different wavelengths ok that means that tthe  noise  loss may be more for one particular frequency and may be less for another particular another frequency the trouble is  when you take a waveform  specially a digital waveform  which is a square waveform and if you analyse it  you will get a lot of spectral component iif you do a fuller transformation on that  you will get the different harmonics or components of that particular wave shape and the and these for that for the perfect square shape to come up  these different harmonics have to be at specific strengths compared to each other ddue to differential losses at different frequencies  what would happen is that their balance would get disturbed what you will actually see is that your pulse shape has changed  refer slide time  08  54 ? 09  23 min  this is known as chromatic dispersion ? chromatic because it depends on the wavelength or frequency  or the color of the light that is why it ? s called chromatic different spectral components of pulse travel at different velocities  noise  tthis is another problem and there is something called group velocity dispersion so wwe get some kind of velocity for all these different components and this leads to some kind of dispersion  noise   refer slide time  09  24 ? 09  46 min  so this is an example of chromatic pulse ? we need not go into the details of this  but this is the input pulse whereas in the output pulse  it has a much more flattened shape because these different components have been attenuated differently as they went along the fiber for compensating these dispersions  nowadays some special types of fibers have come up ; we can not go into details of these ? one is the reduced dispersion fiber by dispersion shifted fibers we mean the natural dispersion is that is sort of acted on nonzero dispersion shifted fibers anyway  the point is that normal smf is there in most of the places  say  more than ninety five percent95 % of the deployed plant dispersion is measured in pico second per nanometer kilometer ; so dispersion is much lower for some of the interesting areas or the window  we get an almost zero dispersion for these fibers so we can get very special fiber these days  which may be utilized for very long haul applications  where dispersion becomes a problem by the way  for short haul applications  when you are travel through a few kilometers  then the dispersion is not much of a problem and we need not bother about dispersion shifted characteristics of the fiber because in ordinary fiber  whatever the dispersion it gives in that small distance  will not matter so much  refer slide time  11  20  11  25 min  we have a bandwidth span product ; that means  how much bandwidth for what kind of distance this is very common in almost all kinds of transmission lines ok  noise  sso a transmission line  which operates at a particular speed quite well for some distance  will not operate that well if you either increase the rate at which you are pumping in the data  increase the frequency  or if you keep the data rate constant and increase the length that would also not work very well sso for any kind of medium  we get the bandwidth distance product  which tends to be more or less sort of constant so aa fiber which is good for at a particular speed for lets 2 kilometers may be just good enough for 1 km when you double the data rate  refer slide time  12  25  13  26 min  for older kind of smf at 1310 nm  we get high speed ? mean these are some typical figures  they are not exact figures ; these are some typical figures to get some ideas sso we can operate at two point five giga 2.5 gbits/sec for six forty kilometers640 kms without amplification  or 10 gb/sec for  let ? s say  100 kms a decent smf can take up to two point five giga bits per second 2.5 gb/sec for four thousand four hundred kilometers 4400 kms,ok which spans from one continent to another or ten giga bits per second 10 gb/sec for five hundred kilometers 500 kms of course  you should multiply these figures for dwdm dwdm we will talk about wdm presently  where it gives you a large number of channels  may be forty 40 channels so you can see that you can realize really tremendous data rate  very very high data rate  using this fiber optic communication and that is the major advantage of fiber tthere are  of course  other advantages like have i mean you are not susceptible to electromagnetic radiations ; that is one good thing because nowadays with so many gadgets all around and so many things moving around  we get all kinds of very noisy electromagnetic ambience ; but  noise  i mean fiber is immune to all that that s that is the good point about fiber  refer slide ime  13  59  4  46 min  next  from fiber  we come to light source that is the led light source is of course of two types  depending on whether we are using multi mode fiber or single mode fiber usually  we would use ordinary light in a multi mode fiber and the source of the ordinary light would be led one good thing about the led led is of course that it is very cheap sso the good thing about multi mode fiber is that it is cheap ; the only thing is that it will not scale up very well with that bandwidth distance product an led led is just a forward biased pn-junction ; what happens is that recombination of injected minority carriers by spontaneous emission produces light and it is a broad spectrum up to gain bandwidth of the medium ; so that is an led  refer slide time  14  47  15  42 min  it is usually of a low power ok power you remember that for power you have to divide it by time although you might get a continuous source of light  it will be comparatively low power like twenty d b m 20 dbm  of low internal modulation so you can modulate it if you internally modulate it you can modulate it at best of with hundreds of mega bits/sec  per second which of course  for some applications  may be more than enough speed but then again  when you are talking about the core of wide area network  then it may not it may be it will is a very low speed so obviously in the core of a wide area network  we will not be using multimode fibers or leds led slicing is led plus a filter iit gives some power loss ; we need not bother about that at the moment  refer slide time  15  43  15  50 min  the other kind of light source  which is very important  is the laser ; ok of course  we use semiconductor lasers here almost always it gives a high i mean much higher power output so in a short duration of time we get quite intense pulses of light that is very good ; it has a high power output ; it has got a sharp spectrum ; that is it is coherent ; that is  it is not at the wide range of spectrum  refer slide time  16  12  16  42 min  so it is sharp spectrum  that is the property of a laser that reduces the chromatic dispersion it can be modulated either internally or externally  so that is also a good point it is good for longer distances and larger bit rates compared to mlm mnf  refer slide time  16  43  17  45 min  mlm we need not bother about mlm we have some special kind of devices  the tunable lasers tunable lasers means a laser  but we can change the color of light over a certain range and as we will see later  the tunable laser may be quite important in some cases we will see what kind of time we require for tuning ; it ? s fairly rapid in the sense that it is in less than milliseconds ? range in the order of milliseconds  we can change the frequency emitted by the lasing system it has a wide and continuous range of over hundred nanometer 100 nm ; has a long lifetime and is stable over lifetime ; and it is easily controllable and manufacturable these are the good points about the tunable lasers  refer slide time  17  46  18  21 min  the methods could be eelectro optical ; changing the refractive index by injecting the current or applying an electromagnetic field sso that is one way ; it could be temperature tuning although it is not much preferred first of all its range is narrow and then it may degrade the lifetime of a laser if you want to do it through temperature ; or mechanical tuning using mems mems this is compact but one problem of this tunable laser is that it is costly ; it is quite costly and that is why this is not very common ; also  it is slightly more complex to manage but in some instances  it gives some advantages we will mention this point later on when we discuss wdm wdm  refer slide time  18  43  19  20 min  then wwe come to receivers ? are of course the light pulse coming will have to be detected by something  whether a pulse has come or whether the pulse has not come  whether it ? s one 1 or a zero 0 sso if an photon comes  it will sort of push up an electron to a conduction band sso that is the standard photo detector  which you must have studied at school so if it is sort of higher than this gap  this energy gap  then we get the electron in the conduction band  which will naturally show up by conducting ; so that is the easiest thing  refer slide time  19  21  21  03 min  i was mentioning that nowadays we have fibers running for thousands of kilometers sso if we have such long haul fibers  what would happen is that naturally  after some distance  what you have to do is that your signal will become weak  so you have to amplify this previously this distance would be something of the order of four five kilometers 4 ? 5kms ok nnowadays twenty five kilometers 5 kms is very common  you can go hundreds  or in special cases  you can go even up to many hundreds of kilometers ; you can go without amplification but whatever it is  after some distance if  because of this loss  absorption  dispersion  etc  you will have to amplify the signal for optical signals traveling long distance through fiber  it needs to be strengthened this may be done through olt olt  which was the older technology in olt  what was done was that  the optical signal was converted back to the electronic domain and then you amplify the signal and then push it back to the optical domain obviously this has quite a number of disadvantages  main disadvantage being cost and the speed ; that means cost is higher and speed is lower that has some advantages also i will mention it later ; this may be done in optical domain the idea was the that  it could be done in optical domain through erbium doped fiber amplifiers there are other kinds of dopers that i will mention ; we will see that  refer slide time  21  04  21  27 min  so this is the scenario ? we have this light propagating and as it propagates with distance  the signal level comes down when it comes down to minimum operating level  at that point  we will have an amplifier that will amplify the signal back ; and then again  after sometime  it will sort of decay and then we again amplify so these are some kind of repeaters  refer slide time  21  28  23  33 min  we come to one point where simple amplification is not always enough ; sometimes we require regeneration these are the so-called 3rs  reamplify  reshape and retime as far as absorption is concerned  if you simply amplify  that means increase the size  the strength of the signal is good enough so the absorption loss or the loss of strength can be handled that way but when you talk about very long distances  due to chromatic dispersion  etc  wave shape will become distorted as we have seen in very long distance  on the other side there will be tremendous amount of errors that may not be acceptable so we have to get a wave into shape now there are some special kinds of fibers ; try to do it in optical domain but more commonly they are deployed today to bring them to electronic domain and then give them the right square shape once again so that is the second r ; and the third r is the timing ; that means how do you keep all the clocks synchronized because  after all  some tdm signals  etc  are traveling ; so you will have to have a very strict control over the time so these reamplify  reshape  and retime  are the 3 r kind of regeneration sometimes we only do with two r 2 rs or simply one r 1 r  which is simply reamplify  which can be done simply with an edfa  that is  the erbium doped fiber amplifiers ; and at certain distances  we simply reamplify this  refer slide time  23  34  24  32 min  if you want to do some reshaping  suppose this is the input shape  which has come this goes through the oe transformation  the optical domain  and we come to the electronic domain we amplify this ; shape this properly ; and then again push it back from the electronic domain to the optical domain so we again get a nicely shaped pulse and the output  which has been strengthened as well as reshaped the problem of this is that  naturally  we can do the reshaping as well as amplification at the same time but one problem that we face in this case is that the cost is high ; and the other problem is that optics inherently can operate at a very high speed but we can get fairly high-speed electronics also but it becomes more and more difficult in the electronic domain as the speed becomes higher and higher and when that happens we would like to do it in optical domain if we could and there are a number of schemes today for handling this in the optical domain for example  we can have some very specially shaped optical waves  whose shape will not change over a distance they are called solitons ; they are sort of done in a way that different spectral components are mixed in such a manner that after dispersion  they cancel out each other similarly there are fibers which give the dispersion in the opposite direction to the standard fiber so that it can be brought back to shape so these are all the atoms to handle this reshaping in the optical domain  but the most widely deployed system as of today is to take it to the electronic domain and do it there  refer slide time  25  51  26  57 min  regenerators are specific bit rate  so that is another problem with the electronic domain it is an opaque unit ; that means it has specific bit rate and modulation format that is used ; whereas optical amplifiers  in optical domain what ever is coming is being amplified so it is transparent to the bit rate  the modulation format  the protocol  etc ; it is transparent to all that whatever is coming  is simply amplifying so that is the good thing about optical amplifiers the system with optical amplifiers can be more easily upgraded to higher bit rate  without replacing the amplifiers if you are going to use the same infrastructure for higher bit rate as service providers often want to do  in that case  if you are taking it to the electronic domain  you have to replace optical amplifiers have large gain bandwidth ; they are also key enablers of dense wavelength division multiplexing  refer slide time  26  58  27  31 min  one of the standard kinds of fiber amplifiers  which is very widely deployed  is the erbium doped fiber amplification ? we have talked about this earlier erbium has a large number of excited states and from some of the excited states  it gives out this 1550 nm light  exactly the wavelength used in the third window a few meters of optical fiber doped with a few parts per million of erbium is pumped with 1480 or 980 nm laser to give amplification  refer slide time  27  32  27  46 min  so edfas amplify all lambdas in the 1550 window simultaneously so key performance parameters include saturation output power  noise figure  gain flatness  pass band  etc  refer slide time  27  47  28  23 min  we have input signal coming through regular fiber and this is the part which is erbium doped and you pump some laser so these are combined using some kind of couplers ; i will be talking about couplers later on because of the pumping laser  the erbium ions become excited and when the incoming signal hits these  they fall back to the ground state may be emitting more photons  so the signal is amplified  refer slide time  28  24  29  11 min  there is another kind of amplifier called raman amplifier  which uses longer lengths of fiber this has other advantages  basically using raman scattering  so we are not going to the details of this once again it has pumping through some kind of pump and signal this pump may be in the same direction as the signal is going or it may be counter pumped in the other direction ; the whole point is that  this pump keeps the atoms excited and  due to raman scattering  so more and more photons come out  so we get an amplified signal finally  refer slide time  29  12  29  45 min  we have other kinds of dopants also  erbium doped for 1550 nm range  praseodymium doped fluoride fiber  pdffa  for 1310 nm  thorium doped for 1350 ? 1450 nm  thulium doped ? well  this is somewhat more academic  because thulium is considered as a rare material ; it is not easily available and even if it is available  it is quite costly anyway this is in the 1450 ? 1530 nm range   refer slide time  29  46  30  03 min  tellerium erbium doped fibers in 1532 ? 1608 nm range raman amplifiers address an extended spectrum using standard single mode fiber that is the good thing about raman amplifier  refer slide time  30  03  30  09 min  so edfas are popular in c-band  raman are proposed for s-band  and gain shifted edfa for l-band etc  refer slide time  30  10  30  32 min  we can have a look at this ? depending on the wavelengths  different kinds of doped and different kinds of fiber amplifiers become is more relevant  like edfa for this range from 1550 etc  tdfa  pdfa  raman amplification for this entire range  etc now we talk about some more components  the first component we talk about is  refer slide time  30  45  31  07 min  some sort of passive device called a coupler optical coupler combines and splits signal wavelengths independent or selective ; that means  the coupler can be wavelength independent as well as wavelength selective ; fabricated using waveguides in integrated optics light couples from one waveguide to a closely placed waveguide because the propagation mode overlaps the two waveguides  refer slide time  31  08  31  40 min  so this is the picture  we have an input waveguide coming in and another input may come ; and there are 2 outputs so what might happen is that it may be used as a coupler ; that means  2 signals joining together  like we wanted to do when we tried to put in a pump in the edfa amplifier or it may be used for splitting the signal coming from one and it is getting split into two directions so this can be used in various ways  refer slide time  31  41  32  3 min  so if ? is the coupling ratio  power output 1 is ? times power of input 1 whereas power output 2 is 1 ? ? times power of input 1 so you see that together the input power is split into two parts if you want to have ? = ?  these are so-called 3-db couplers we put half the power in input 1 and half the power in output 2 if you want to broadcast the same signal to two different destinations  you can use a 3db coupler as i said  light couples from one waveguide to a closely placed waveguide   refer slide time  32  31  32  38 min  iidentical waveguides complete coupling and back periodically sso this is the couple mode theory  refer slide time  32  39  33  06 min  of course we have to follow the conservation of energy constraint so you can not get more ? since this is a more passive device  we can not get more out of it then when you put in actually you get less  so it is possible that electric fields at two outputs have the same magnitude so they are exactly the same  but will be 90 ? out of phase and lossless combining is not possible  so nothing is really 100 % efficient  refer slide time  33  07  33  50 min  passive star is a sort of generalization of this it ? s a broadcast device to more than one recipient it divides the received signal to all output ports at original wavelength ; of course  if you divide the same signal into so many different signals  the received strength of the signal will be proportionally less you have to handle it by either amplification or some other thing  or maybe  weak signal is good enough for your application etc so n ? n passive stars can route n simultaneous connections through  refer slide time  33  51  34  12 min  this is an example of an eight-port splitter whatever signal is coming  it is getting divided into two and again divided into two so we get eight signals over here ; we can actually use some 3-db couplers to form this eight port splitter from y-couplers  refer slide time  34  13  34  35 min  this is another example of an 8 ? 8 star coupler there are 8 lines ; any of these might communicate something which will be broadcast to all the other seven ports so such things are used for broadcasting  refer slide time  34  36  35  26 min  we now come to optical modulation ; that means how we modulate it of course the simple modulation scheme ? since we are talking only about digital systems ? is on/off keying  that means either on or off or 1 or 0 there are two types of modulation techniques  namely  direct modulation versus external modulation in modulation  the extinction ratio of output power for bit = 1 to output power for bit = 0 is very important we want this to be as high as possible some lasers can not be directly modulated ; that is one problem another problem with direct modulation is that you are modulating at the source  modulating at the same place  from where that light is being generated whatever diode or whatever you are using for generating it  we want to modulate through that only so that is the direct modulation  whereas in indirect modulation  what we will do is that there is a continuous source of light and just as the light comes out  we will modulate it we will put it on or off by making it go through something so that is the external modulation  refer slide time  36  00  36  22 min  so the solution is ? naturally since direct modulation has the problem about the chirp  etc ? external modulation for higher speeds  longer distance dispersion  limited regimes  etc we prefer external modulation the light source is continuously operated external modulation turns light signal on or off ; so this is the optical modulation  refer slide time  36  23  36  49 min  they can be integrated in the same package as laser ; the laser source is there and the modulator is external  but they can be packaged electro absorption or ea modulator is one important kind of modulator ; it applies an electric field  shrinks the band gap and photons are absorbed  refer slide time  36  50  37  03 min  so this is the picture  this is the continuous source of this light  which is being modulated  that is  being put on or off depending on whether you want to transmit 1 or 0  refer slide time  37  04  37  52 min  the next set of components are multiplexers  filters  and gratings we will talk a little bit about it if you look at this  these are all wavelength selective devices  multiplexers  filters  and gratings in a wavelength filter suppose ? 1  ? 2  etc so many ? s are coming  but i want only ? 1 out ? 2  ? 3  ? 4  etc  are absorbed ; whereas if you are a multiplexer  i want the different ? s coming in different lines i want all to be mixed together and use the same line that is a wavelength multiplexer  refer slide time  37  53  39  20 min  so the application could be particular wavelength or a particular wave band selection wave bands are nothing but some contiguous  operating wavelengths  which all are side by side in the operating window  whatever be the window you are using ? 1550 or whatever ? you can have a number of ? s  all side by side there is a guard band between each of these operating ? s ? the iqt has specified how much guard band etc  you will have to have you can have large number of ? s  all grouped together in the same window now you can select a band out of that  a bunch of frequencies out of that  instead of selecting only one ; that is wavelength band selection static wavelength cross connects and oadms oadms  optical add drop multiplexers   you have come across this term  optical add drop multiplexers in the context of sonet  but in the optical domain we require optical add drop multiplexers ; we will come to that equalization of gain  that is another application ; filtering of noise ; ideas used in laser operation and dispersion compensation modules etc these are the different applications  refer slide time  39  21  40  20 min  one of the standard wavelength selective components is arrayed waveguide gratings these are curved selection of silica acting as waveguides each waveguide is slightly different in length the incoming signal is split to be slightly different in length is like a running track bend ? in a running track you know that the outer track  in any athletic event  in an 800 m race or something  the outer track is longer than the inner track that is why athletes are given proper handicap  because we want to make all the distances same here deliberately  we want the distances to be different if they are different  they are going to sort of arrive out of phase at the output the incoming signal is split ; every wavelength then travels down each waveguide  refer slide time  40  21  40  34 min  time delayed signals recombine to give each wavelength its own waveguide ; can be reversed to act as a multiplexer rather than a demultiplexer ; usable in optical integrated circuits ; easily combined with other functions  refer slide time  40  35  41  11 min  this is the picture we had seen earlier  if your light is going in this direction  what you are doing is that you are demultiplexing one bunch of frequencies are coming ; we want all these different colors to get separated out so that is the demultiplexing action going on if different wavelengths or different colors of light are coming in the other direction  it ? s just the direct opposite thing  and we will get a multiplexer  so it is an awb acting either as a multiplexer or demultiplexer  depending on how you operate  refer slide time  41  12  43  07 min  s we come to optical switches ; we have seen electrical switches now we will talk little bit about optical switches what is optical switching ? you remember electrical switching ? in electrical switching  there are some one input lines coming in line i and i want to get that signal out through line j so we want to operate the switch through the switch or something  want to connect the ith line and jth line the basic idea was that the signal coming down from ith line has to go out of the jth output line that was the simple switching element it is the same thing here also ; some wavelength is coming through some fiber  that is  one input port we want to get it out of another fiber for the time being  we do not have any wavelength conversion kind of thing  thus the same wavelength has to push it to another fiber so that is my switching at the optical plane redirecting light from one optical fiber to another without electrical conversion so we are always harping on that without electrical conversion  we can operate it at a much higher way and higher speed secondly it may be cheaper also  to operate at high speeds ; it will be cheaper and then if you upgrade eventually  this is going to be transparent this does not depend on the underlying protocol  etc  that is being used at the higher layer these are the other advantages of doing at the optical plane now  the most advanced optical switching technology is mems  that is  tiny movable mirrors  refer slide time  43  08  43  13 min  so this is the crossbar switch 4 ? 4 switch  refer slide time  43  14  44  09 min  we have seen this picture also that is a mems optical cross connect you see that these are all tiny mirrors ; what i can do is that  to follow the red line which is coming  we are using these two mirrors to push it to line number 3 over here ? from line number 1 to line number 3 this way  by just adjusting the angles of the mirrors which we can do through the mems technology  we can have a simple and elegant kind of switch the light goes and bumps off a couple of mirrors and goes out the other fiber whatever signals it is carrying  what protocol it is carrying is immaterial ; similarly  the data rate also is immaterial this is a mems optical cross connect now all this technology sort of enables what is known as the wdm technology  which is a wavelength division multiplexing as i was mentioning when we were discussing multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing is nothing but frequency division multiplexing ; that means  you want different channels to come at different frequencies it ? s just the opposite of optical domain in wavelength division multiplexing  different wavelengths and different ? s are getting together and light with different wavelengths can very well mix together and go to the other end for example  sunlight has all the frequencies that are mixed up to appear as white light to us ; if you send this through a prism  all the frequencies split up so we will get some kind of a demultiplexing action so you want to use this property for wavelength division multiplexing for achieving very high data rates there are two kinds of wavelength division multiplexing  or wdm  that people talk about mostly in the backbone  people use dwdm dwdm means dense wavelength division multiplexing by dense we mean that we put a lot of channels  lot of ? s side by side  so we get a lot of channels of course  dwdm would not usually be deployed in a lan because dwdm is costly but then  at the backbone  where you are talking about very high speed that cost is effective ; whereas another kind of wavelength division multiplexing is coming into lans  which is called cwdm or coarse wavelength division multiplexing there the wavelengths are not so closely packed ; they are sort of more sparsely placed  which is a good thing because then  the stability of these laser sources  detectors etc  are less of an issue so cdwm tends to be cheaper than dwdm and cwdm is coming into use these days we will start our discussion on wavelength division multiplexing in this lecture and then we will continue in the next lecture with the details of wavelength division multiplexing  refer slide time  46  53  47  07 min  wdm increases the capacity of optical fibers ; different wavelength lasers  each transmit at same time down the same fiber ; multiplexing is combining wavelengths ; demultiplexing is splitting of wavelengths  refer slide time  47  08  48  03 min  usually the number of wavelengths is in the power of 2  4  8  16  64  128  etc  things like 32  64 etc  are big 16  32  64 are deployed ; now people are talking about hundreds of wavelengths  may be even thousands wavelengths are separated by multiples of 0.8 nm guard band  i mentioned this is equivalent to 100 ghz there is 100 ghz separation between two ? s ; that is the minimum separation  which is mandated by the itu standard coarse wdm has widely separated wavelengths so that the components can be little less sophisticated and much more cheaper  refer slide time  48  04  48  25 min  this is a wdm system ; different lasers of different lights coming together to the multiplexer  flowing down the same fiber at the same time  being demultiplexed on the other end the multiplexer  demultiplexer could be an awg or some other  refer slide time  48  26  48  59 min  in point-to-point wdm system  one point is connected to another point through multiple wavelengths wdm is the most cost-effective technology in point-to-point technology  where the distance is about greater than 50 kms in shorter distances  multi fiber is cheaper because in dwdm naturally your end equipment tends to become quite costly if you have some extra strands of fiber  then that may be a cheaper option  refer slide time  49  00  49  48 min  wavelength add drop multiplexer is one thing we require  when we want to add on to a stream of wdm that is going through a fiber  or we want to add on some extra wavelengths on the wave or we want to take just one wavelength out and let the others pass through so that is a wavelength add drop multiplexer needed for routing and wavelength assignment it performs the same functions as the electronic counterpart at the level of wavelengths we had come across its electronic counterparts like adm in sonet ; the same thing happens in the optical domain one problem is that granularity is high  because of inherent capacity of wavelengths ; so even if you take out one single wavelength out of a whole bunch of wavelengths  that one single wavelength can carry a large amount of traffic  let us say  2.5 gbps ? that is a high amount of traffic if there are small amounts of traffic which you want to add or drop  then this is not a very effective technology  refer slide time  50  12  50  36 min  wadm has multiplexers and a set of 2 ? 2 switches  one for each wavelength they are managed electronically ; that means  these switches  etc are programmed electronically to control which incoming length flows through and which is dropped  refer slide time  50  37  51  01 min  so fiber and wavelength cross connects are important components of this wdm  needed in real networks point-to-point connection does not need a passive star  or a passive router or active switch  but in wdm  we may require all these for an entire communication network we have discussed this  refer slide time  51  02  51  51 min  passive router  it can route separately each wavelength  no wavelength conversion ; it allows wavelength reuse  same wavelength can carry multiple connections through the router for example  the same wavelength coming from fiber 1 going through fiber 3 and the same wavelength coming in from fiber 2 and going out through fiber 4 is perfectly possible if enough wavelengths are there  n ? n router  can route n2 simultaneous connections ; some routing issues are there we will discuss the routing issues in the next lecture  refer slide time  51  52  52  17 min  finally  we may have some active switch  which has all the features that a passive router has the difference is that active routing matrix  which has some functionality  has to be powered this is of course an issue when you are talking about a very long haul  refer slide time  52  18  52  20 min  with this we conclude our initial portion of our discussion and in the next lecture we are going to discuss the details of wdm ; that is  how different wavelengths are routed through the network how we can get an entire network output thank you preview of next lecture computer networks prof sujoy ghosh dept of computer science& engineering iit kharagpur lecture 11 routing and wavelength assignment in wdm all optical networks  refer slide time  52  49 min  good day  so iin this lecture  we are going to continue our discussion on wavelength deviation and multiplexing specifically we are going to talk about routing and wavelength assignment  refer slide time  53  09-54  14 min  rrouting and wavelength assignment to what ? well routing and wavelength assignment means that we have some stream of packets or whatever data or whatever communication is going on from one source to one destination now tthese sources and destination  first of all one thing is of course of point to point connection is if there is point to point connection is directly sends to the fiber that is  noise  simple but in general  they will not be directly connected general tthey will go through a network   noise  they go through some intermediate notes to reach the destination sso this for this stream  we have to route this that is one problem and the other thing is that may be they are all the stream right some particular wavelength for the time being llet us assume that it is continued on the same wavelength sso we have to assign one wave length  so we have this problem of routing and wavelength assignment  refer slide time  54  15 54  23 min  in wdm all optical networks ok of course we can do  noise  routing etc  very easily in the electronic domain   noise  that is known  noise  routing in the electronic domain how it is done etc  are we are not discussed is as easier we were discussed it  later on iin the this these series of lectures but routing  i mean we are talking about a simple kinds of routing problem here sso we will talk about routing and wave length assignment  refer slide time  54  43-56  53 min  sso this is an example of light path establishment  suppose you have these a b c d e abcde these are connected so iin the first part  the left half of the figure what we have is the physical connection from aa to bb  there is a connection and bb to dd there is a connection and so on iin this one  noise  ii show some  noise  that means some  noise  rw routing and wavelength assignment has already been done and some of the wavelengths and some of the links have been used sso here only two 2 wavelengths are used  let us say aa to bb  noise  they are not connected say a to c a to c the a to c a to c light path has been established via bb so and aa to bb  there will be a switch which will switch the  noise  and suppose this dashed line is the lambda one lambda 1 sso the lambed lambda1 a one coming through this fiber from a to b a to b that is switched to lambda one lamda 1  noise  using the same wavelength to the outgoing fiber from b to c b to c so wwe have light a paths established between b to c b to c similarly c to d c to d  there is a light path b to d b to d  there is a light path d to e d to e there is a light path e to f e to f there is a light path d to f d to f  there is a light path and so on  using the same lambda one lamda 1 then ii want to connect e to c e to c now ii can not go from e to c e to c after say lambda one lamda 1 has been  noise  assign ii can not go  but from ee by lambda one lamda 1 to anywhere because all the outgoing fibers the lambda ones lamda 1s have been used up this side  for a this side for bb and this side for f f  noise  sorry sso inorder to connect from e to c e to c  ii use the another wavelength which say lambda two lamda 2 which connects me higher dd so and the dd cross connect will connect this particular lambda lamda from this fiber to this fiber so wwe will get a direct  noise  light path from e to c e to c ssimilarly we will get a light path from b to f b to f using lambda two lamda 2a to b a to b using lambda two lamda 2 and this way   noise  they are all connected  refer slide time  56  55-57  40 min  aa burst has a long and variable length payload  if it is long low amortized overhead no fragmentation aa control packet is sent out of band that means using some other lambda lambda lamda control and reserves bandwidth that is lambda lamda data reserves a particular bandwidth along a particular path and configures the switches sso it is like a setting up temporary light path from the source to the destination ok aa burst is sent after an offset time  it arrives at a switch after it has been configured sso no buffering is needed  so our original problem is of not having optical buffer sso buffers in the optical domain that is avoided in this fashion  refer slide time  57  42-58  20 min  sso what will happen is that  this will now moving towards the other end to the next node and  noise  here this will again  noise  do some  noise  do the go through the o to e o two e and then do the  noise  switch  noise  configuration and then again e to o e to o and go to the next half and this delay etc  is calculated in such a fashion that when the burst arrives  what happens is that we when the burst arrives at the intermediate node  the switch fabric is already configured sso you do not have to store it  you simply simply passes through in the optical domain sso that is  refer slide time  58  21-58  44 min  nice so offset of course is now t minus delta t ?  because it spent delta ? amount of time over here sso without any delay  the burst goes through the optical switch fabric  so depending on how many intervening notes are there  you have to have this original tt  so that finally when the tt is exhausted offset is exhausted but you have also reached your  noise  destination
