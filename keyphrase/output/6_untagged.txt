computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh dept of computer science & engineering iit kharagpur lecture no # 6 telecom networks good day ! today we will talk about telecom networks that means the kind of network that is used by telephones and  of course nowadays  by a host of other things as we will discuss this telecom network  refer slide time  01  10  01  38  is very important in the sense that first of all it is one of the earliest networks that we had ; which means it is quite old secondly  the telecom network even today is mostly used for wide area communication we have much fewer entirely or exclusive data networks so we will look at the evolution of telecom networks  refer slide time  01  46  03  22  when alexander graham bell developed the first telephone  it was a couple of telephone instruments connected by a wire now if you are trying to connect more than one people  that means more than one subscribers  taking this principle forward  you will have to connect everybody to everybody else through wire  which of course becomes very unwieldy very soon it ? s because connecting the wires between every pair of telephones that might want to communicate was not a good long-term strategy at all very soon we could have a veritable jungle of wires and  of course  it means it is costly and very difficult to manage even at the subscriber end  you can not handle so many wires coming into your premise so a better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office ; there an operator could connect one telephone to another via a switch board that is the next figure that you see ; that the number of wires have come down as a matter of fact  in the figure at the top  if you have n subscribers  naturally you have n  n  ? 1/2 links  which is approximately n2 kind of links ; whereas in the latter case  you have only n links so the number of links increases as n becomes large and you know today there are so many telephone subscribers ; so there is no question of connecting them individually you have to connect them to a central switching office and when some subscriber a wants to connect to subscriber b  it goes via the switching office and finally a connection is made  refer slide time 03  49-07  00  now in the switching office in this system  a telephone user could connect to any other telephone in the town by cranking a handle ; this was the old system you know in the old system ? if you have seen some of older movies or movies depicting an older time ? somebody would go to the telephone  lift it up  and go with the handle like this ? crank crank crank ? and what this would do is that basically this would ring some kind of a bell or give some indication in the central switching office the switch operator was of course a person  may be lady  who would know that this is the person who wants to talk to somebody then he would talk to that person and find out who it is or who the subscriber is to whom he wants to be connected when the subscriber tells connect me to such and such  through a wire  jumper wire  the telephone operator would connect this subscriber to the indented subscriber that is how it would operate in the beginning  which of course is a rather a difficult thing to do and it is unbelievable that with today ? s teledensity we can handle in that way so after this  this role of the person was replaced by some electromechanical gadget and those exchanges were called stowager exchanges there is an interesting story about the stowager exchange ? it seems that there was a person called mr stowager ; he was an undertaker you know who an undertaker is ; he sort of prepares coffins for a person who has passed away it just so happened that there was another undertaker in the same town  whose wife was actually the telephone operator so whenever somebody wanted to connect to an undertaker necessarily her husband would get the job so mr stowager thought that was not a good idea at all ; so he went ahead and designed some kind of electromechanical system so that there would be relays and mechanical switches would sort of rotate  depending on what you have dialed on the other side and connect this electromechanical exchange served us quite well and even may be 15 or 20 years back in this country you could see stowager exchanges were operating but of course nowadays  these electromechanical things have been replaced by electronic switches and the architecture also has become more complicated so this is how the switching office used to operate previously there would be an operator physically who would make a connection  who would make a physical copper connection through a wire from the caller to the callee  using jumper cable on a plug board and there would be a connection between the two telephones so that is how it used to operate  refer slide time  07  01  08  42  nowadays we have a picture which is something like this ; you can see that there is a local exchange building  where there is a local exchange switch  the kind of signal that is used for connecting this part ? the local exchange ? to the individual subscribers by the way this part is also called the local loop in telephone parlance so the telephones still use analog carrier systems mostly and you see there are two types of wires used over here  one is sort of connecting the premise of each individual subscriber to some kind of a housing  may be some kind of a hut over here  through a category 3 cable  which is a thick kind of black cable  which actually comes into your home so these cables  yellow colored  are much thicker  may be 50 pair or 100 pair kind of cables these category 3 cables in this hut are connected to this through this ; it goes to the local exchange where switching is done what is switching ? suppose this user wants to talk to this subscriber so there would be a switch over here because there are individual pairs of wires going from each subscriber to the local exchange and the switch would connect these two pairs of wires and they would have get connected this is the scheme  refer slide time  08  43  10  18  now when telephones developed more and more  naturally people found it very useful so it was soon apparent that callers did not just want to talk to people in the same town  but also to people in neighbouring towns now this was the next hurdle to be solved the first one was that the all pairs of telephones can not be connected together so every subscriber was only connected to the local exchange or the local switching office  where individual subscribers would be connected now if you have two different towns in two different locations  what would happen is that you can not connect all of them to the same local exchange this is a problem ; first of all from one town to another the distance would be quite large so irrespective of where you put your exchange  whether in this town or that town or somewhere in-between  there will be lot of wires involved and naturally this is not feasible so what is required is that there will be a local exchange for this town and there will be another local exchange for that town and these two exchanges have to be connected so this was the next step in telecom evolution ; so to connect every telephone in a number of towns to a single switching office was obviously impractical as the wires were too long  refer slide time  10  19  12  17  so we came to the so-called trunk exchanges ; now what are trunk exchanges ? well  there are local exchanges and if one local exchange wants to go through to another local exchange  it usually goes through a trunk exchange ; this is a two-tier hierarchy there will be some trunk exchanges and then each of the trunk exchanges would be connected to a number of local exchanges and the trunk exchanges would be connected between themselves in some fashion automatic switching office enables connections in a fraction of a second that means your connection request ? if it is local  then the connection request is just served by the local exchange that means if you just want to make a local call between two subscribers who are under the same exchange  it need not go anywhere else ; it can just simply be locally connected if the caller and callee are under two different local exchanges  it is possible that their local exchanges are connected but the general scenario is that they would go to the trunk exchange and the trunk exchange would connect to other local exchange and then that local exchange would make the connection available to the callee so this is how connections are set up as telecom grew bigger and bigger  you not only want to talk to the person in the next town  you want to talk to the person in next state and may be in the next county or a country around the world so in that case also more levels of hierarchy came into the picture as we will see here  refer slide time  12  17  12  47  and soon customers wanted to talk to people in different regions  states and other countries to cope with this  even more tiers were added to the hierarchy to make a call  we now dial a number this number is examined by the local exchange  which decides if it can connect you with local telephone or if it needs to connect you via a higher level switching office so this is the public switched telephone network that we have today or namely pstn  refer slide time  12  48  13  36  at the bottom of this figure we have these individual telephones  which are connected to the local exchanges and the local exchanges may be connected to some trunk exchanges these trunk exchanges may be connected to still other trunk exchanges and so on not only that  the picture is even messier than it is shown here for example  some of the local exchanges would connect between themselves straight away if there are lots of calls between two local exchanges  then the telephone company might like to connect fiber between these two exchanges for example  let us say in india  if you are making a local call  that is fine if you are making a call which is to an exchange that is just adjacent  then you would go through some connection between the exchanges if you want to make an std inside the same state then this trunk exchange would somehow go to the trunk exchange on the remote side if you are going out of a circle ? for example  west bengal may be a telecom circle and then bihar would be another telecom circle so the main trunk exchange of west bengal would be in kolkata and the main trunk exchange of bihar would be in patna ; so these two from kolkata to patna main trunk exchanges would be connected through very high speed lines and what would happen is that  it will go from the subscriber to the local exchange to the local trunk exchange to the main trunk exchange at kolkata and then to main trunk exchange in bihar  let us say in patna  and then to further trunk exchanges then further to local exchanges and then to the final callee of course  if you have international calls  if you are making isd calls  then you have to go through still other hierarchy ; that means  there are some particular gateways through which you will have to come before you can go out of the country  refer slide time  15  15  16  24  there is a question of routing a telephone call routing a telephone call means  how do you find this way ? that from one exchange to another exchange to trunk exchanges to other trunk exchanges and finally to the destination  you have to make a connection ; that means on each of the switch on the way  you will have to make some provision or some connection for this particular telephone connection so how do you find out ? for example a particular trunk exchange may be connected to a number of local exchanges and then number of other trunk exchanges also so how do you know which trunk exchange to go to next ? this is the problem of routing so you have to route a telephone call in older telephone systems  when you made a call the switching office set up a physical link called a copper path between your telephone and the callee ? s telephone the way that the copper path is set up is called routing in a telephone network  routing is usually straightforward and i will come to the reason  refer slide time  16  26 -20  12  a call is routed up through higher level switching offices until it reaches a switching office that can reach the destination telephone by connecting with lower level switching offices the switching offices examine the digits of the telephone number you dialed to make these connections so this is really in some sense fairly simple  in the sense that the way the telephone numbers are distributed in any country is in quite a systematic manner for example  let us say if you are making an std call in india  usually we start with the digit 0 now the digit 0 is not really a part of the number of the callee ; digit 0 is just indicating to the local exchange that we will have to be connected to some other exchange this is not the same local exchange so that is some kind of an escape from its local exchange to somewhere else but as i said  the telephone numbers are distributed in a fairly methodical manner for example  after 0 if it is 3  you immediately know that this will be somewhere let say near kolkata ; at least it will go through the kolkata trunk exchange similarly if it is 011  you immediately know ; you do not even have to look at the other digits and as a matter of fact for a remote caller or to the exchange to which the remote caller is connected  the other digits do not make any sense because they are really a number under an exchange which is far away  but it knows just by looking at the first few digits that that is the trunk exchange which i have to reach for example  somebody is making a connection from let us say kolkata to delhi now immediately you would know  suppose from kolkata so you start typing say 011 and then something  the local exchange would know that this is not only a trunk call  it is the so-called subscriber trunk dialing  std  call so this will have to go through the main tax exchange in kolkata in order to connect to that main tax exchange in delhi so it just makes the connection just by looking at those say first two digits and after that whatever digits follow  they will be looked at by the exchange at let us say delhi and then the next few digits may indicate a particular exchange in delhi so it will look at the next few numbers  maybe two or three digits and decide that that is the exchange to which it is connected so it is immediately routed to that exchange and that exchange will look at the last few digits may be and know that this is the subscriber  so the connection would be made so you do not have to really have to search around in the entire country to find out where this number belongs to ; just by looking at the numbers  looking at the digits one or two at a time  you can find out what the next step is that the connection has to take this makes the routing problem easy  unlike some other cases which we will get to later on but for telephone  the routing is fairly straightforward so it will look at the digits and make up the connection  refer slide time  20  12  23  17  and one point is that we are always talking about connections because essentially telephone service is a connection-oriented service what do we mean when we say that telephone service is a connection-oriented service ? it means that ? usually this is sort of changing somewhat a little bit ? the overwhelming majority of telephone connections are still connection-oriented in a connection-oriented service  what happens is that a dedicated connection between the end points is maintained throughout the session when you are actually calling  during the time by looking at the call number the path will be set up and at each point  at each switch  let us assume there is a physical connection  which may not be physical connection  but the connection may be some kind of virtual connection but for our purpose at the moment  let us assume that they are physical connections  so there is a physical connection at each switch so there is a continuous path from the source to the destination from the caller to the callee and this path is maintained  is held reserved  for this particular session during the entire session this is not shared with anybody else and this has number of advantages usually it means the quality of service can be reasonably guaranteed to the extent that the bandwidth for the channel that is established ? whatever bandwidth this channel might be having ? is exclusively for this particular call  for this particular session so there is no contention for bandwidth by multiple users usually we are talking about just landline phones for the time-being so first of all  the bandwidth is held constant  hence the quality of service is good second thing is that since the path  the actual path is held constant  the message bits arrive in the same order in which they are sent by the way  please note that this always need not be so for example if this path was not reserved and held constant for a particular session  that means if some part of your call is going through one path and some other part of your call is going through another path  then later bits may arrive earlier  depending on what these two paths are so such a thing would not happen in a telephone connection usually  so message bits arrive in the same order these are the advantages of having a connection-oriented service  refer slide time  23  18  23  50  so traditional telephone circuit is a circuit switched  that means actual physical connections are made with a connection-oriented system the downside of this is that it is less efficient use of the total available bandwidth the reason that this is less efficient use of the total available bandwidth is that whenever we speak there are ? for example  this is just one of the factors  there are many other factors ? considerable periods of time or epochs of time during which nobody is speaking at that time the channel is lying idle remember this particular channel that has been set up for one particular call is held constant during the duration  during the entire duration of the call so at that time nobody else can use it so this is one source why this is sort of inefficient use of bandwidth another problem  actually a very serious problem ? this happened due to historical reasons ? is that this traditional telephone equipment tends to be more costly now why is that so ? well  the reason is that this telephone system and the way the switches  etc  were designed at least the earlier ones had a long history  and naturally in this particular field  the rate of development of technology is very high and the next generation of technology would always have a tremendous cost benefit advantage compared to the previous generation of technology so it so happened that the computer technology started leading the technology base ; of course it does not mean that the traditional telecom technology was steady only at one point this was also evolving and the computer communication field was also evolving ; but it so happened that some competing technology  which is the so-called connectionless service  came about we have been talking about connection-oriented service in telephone  so in the connectionless service it always or it quite often has the advantage of using the next generation of technology  making it much cheaper and this proved to be a great hindrance to the traditional technology in telephones and that is why most of the traditional service providers are slowly now depending on how they are moving to this new technology  which essentially sort of sprang from another field and that is the so-called connectionless service  refer slide time  26  43  29  36  now  what is a connectionless service ? connectionless service is packet-by-packet ; this is not over the entire session ; one packet of data or that particular data may be containing first data so one particular packet is sort of thrown into the system and routed independently of all other packets so as we had seen earlier that this means that you have to have the destination address at each packet that is one thing ; so if you have the destination address in each packet  may be you can route it fast enough to reach the destination and the next packet from between the same caller and callee will come as another packet it will also have the same destination written on it and it may so happen that some router in-between is going to route it in a different path this connection is not held constant like the connection-oriented service this is a connectionless service ; it is packet-by-packet service this has some disadvantages also for example  one reason is that some of the lines may be good  some other lines may be bad and some of the packets may get dropped in-between secondly  what might happen is that a packet  which had been sent later  may  through a different path  arrive earlier at the destination so all these problems are there in a connectionless service ; but the major advantage of connectionless service  one major advantage is that it is cheaper it is cheaper firstly because it is somewhat more efficient than the traditional circuit switch systems  and secondly it is usually more efficient because it usually tends to use more recent technology in terms of silicon  in terms of ic  etc it has higher volume ; its pricing is lower that is attracting all these other telephone service people also into this technology and there is a definite shift towards this kind of technology by the way  you can take special care to guarantee that the packets are correctly received by the final recipient and in proper order but you have to put in some extra effort for that so we will look into this later  refer slide time  29  37  30  07  as mentioned earlier  each packet must contain the source and the destination address in order to be routed ip networks are based on packet switching technologies so this is what most computer systems use ; special techniques are employed to get some guarantee about the quality of service the technology being cheaper  it is beginning to dominate all networks  traditional networks as well as the current networks  refer slide time  30  08  31  57  by the way  i mentioned this earlier in the lecture that you must remember that it is not that we have a whole parallel network for data from computers  etc  all over the globe it is not there because the telecom network has been around for a long time ; it had a long and very excellent history so that is why even today most of the wide area networks traffic still rides on this telecom network originally it might have been a packet ; then it might be sort of made into some kind of a session for which some part of the connection is dedicated so all kinds of technology have come in  but even today most of the wide area networks are based on the telecom networks and telecom so that is one side of the story the other side of the story is that telecom networks  the telecom people  are actually in the process of routing some of the voice calls and may be some of the other kinds of calls into this packet kind of technology now about the transmission media in telephone systems  we have already talked little bit about it earlier  so i am not going into the details in traditional analog telephone systems the telephone is connected to the local exchange via category 3 utp cables  and the connection is called the local loop it is typically between 1 km and 10 km in length  refer slide time  31  58  35  01  higher up in the hierarchy  higher bandwidth cables are used to carry multiple telephone calls this is far cheaper than using separate cables for separate calls specifically digital lines on fiber are used analog systems use a technique called frequency division multiplexing to do this nowadays of course time division multiplexing is the most dominant standard so if you remember the earlier figure we had  we had this local exchange ; so your particular subscriber would be connected to the local connection hut maybe through a category 3 cable  from that hut a fat cable would usually run to the local exchange and this fat cable ? in most cases today are still basically a collection of pairs of cables ? is just in one sheath so that is why it is a fat cable  physically it is fat maybe there are 50 pairs of cables or 100 pairs of cables ; so if there are 50 subscribers coming into a hut  they can be connected through individual pairs in this bunch of pairs of cables that run from the hut to the local exchange so you may say that up to the local exchange we have these pairs of copper cables running but once you go to the exchange level and beyond  that means  higher up in the hierarchy  like  to the trunk exchanges and so on  there of course you need to carry lot of calls and usually this connection is through fiber so there are all kinds of multiplexing techniques but specifically time division multiplexing  which is the dominant one some specific version of time division multiplexing  which we will see later on  is used today a fiber may easily carry say 1000 voice calls or even 3000 voice calls just on a fiber ; so that is no problem at all for example  think of a connection between let us say two big cities a lot of subscriber pairs from both sides will want to talk to each other at the same time that is the great thing about these fibers  because they can accommodate a large number of channels so it has got a huge bandwidth so they are connected through fiber and all these calls are sort of multiplexed may be in time division multiplex fashion  which goes to the other end  gets the multiplex  and finally feeds to the local loops  which again are individual copper pairs  refer slide time  35  02  36  32  local loop  the subscriber handsets are powered by a battery bank in the exchange for example  i mean with at least the ordinary handsets  you do not need to connect it to any power ; it actually derives its power from the same cable which is coming and connecting your telephone set and with echo suppressors  the transmission is half duplex and with echo cancellors  it is possible to have full duplex communication so if you remember we talked about half duplex and full duplex communication half duplex communication means that the communication can go in either direction from this side to this side or from this side to this side  a to b or b to a ? but then  only in one direction at any one particular point of time so at some point of time a may be connecting to b or a may be transmitting to b and then a will become quiescent and b will be communicating to a through the same the line this is half duplex communication we require some kind of echo suppressors for this because otherwise we will be hearing our own voice  which is really irritating there is a way of echo cancellation and it is possible to have full duplex communication on the same line  refer slide time  36  32  39  07  since local loop is still analog we need modems for sending digital data that is  this local loop being analog has quite a bit of implications ; one of the implications is that when you try to communicate digital data over it ? and we are talking about this telecom network in the context of computer networks  but if you want to connect a computer network to a local loop ? your computer produces digital data so they have to be modulated and demodulated so modems always come in pairs for sending the digital data ; since one bit is used for control purpose we usually get 56 kbps speed on this local line you remember that the computer lines are designed to handle 64 kbps ; 64 kbps is the basic rate for communication purpose if you remember  we have this 4 k bandwidth  which has sampled at doubled the rate  which is the nyquist rate this 8 kilo samples  8 bits per sample is for indicating the level or the intensity of the signal ; so we have 64 kbps so this line is really designed for 64 kbps when you are sending a computer data over it  you are using a modem and these modem pairs  etc  they need to communicate with each other and there is one bit used for control purpose so finally we get a 56 kbps speed ; so that is why now almost everywhere you will see that the modem has 56 kbps speed people talk about 56 kbps modem ; that is where this particular figure comes from but of course although you may be having a 56 kbps modem you may not always get a 56 kbps speed because depending on the line condition  maybe some of the connections are weak  etc so however  it is noisy so it is picking up a lot of noise so depending on that  the two modems will automatically negotiate a lower speed and in actual practice you might find the lower speed for your computer communication  refer slide time  39  08  43  56  and just one another point before i go to signaling ? i want to mention that another implication of having fully analog technology in the local loop is that on an analog signal before you can use tdm or other kinds of multiplexing techniques higher up than all those in-between for connecting between exchanges  etc  you need to convert it to the digital signal over there so an exchange usually will have a bunch of codecs for coders and decoders and there are various coding and decoding standards but any way it will have a bunch of codecs  which will convert the analog signal which is coming through this local loop into a digital signal and now this digital signal is ready to be multiplexed with other digital signals to reach its final destination now let me tell you a little bit about signaling  this is a rather vast area ; we will just be touching upon it we will just mention some names and basically what signaling is signaling refers to the information exchange between terminal devices  exchanges  and routers for setting up circuits  termination  billing  advanced network services  etc so what it means is that when you are making a telephone call ? of course  suppose you are making a simple voice call  what you are finally interested in is that your voice should be audible to the callee at the other side and his voice should be audible to you so this voice should communicate ; that is the main communication which is going on through this channel  but in order to achieve this  all the intermediate nodes ? that could be a local exchange  that could be a trunk exchange  that could be sort of switches in-between  there could be routers and multiplexers ? have to get some information and then need to exchange some information for basic setting up of the line now apart from basic setting up of the line  you need other kinds of services of course from the service provider side  you need to bill a person if he is making a call  you want to bill him  and depending on whether he is making a local call or whether he is making an std call or an isd call  you may bill him at different rates similarly  for making the connections  we have to capture those digits and those digits have to be fed into the particular exchange ; it may be computers  routers  switches  etc so they have to be fed over there in order to make the connection all this is a part of signaling apart from the actual transfer of  let us say  voice or it could even be data but whenever you want to set up some call and take some service  some signaling will always be required so there are various types of signaling systems but it is sort of converging to some standards in common channel signaling there is in band ; by in band we mean the same bandwidth  which is used by the voice  is used by the signaling also why does it not interfere with voice ? well  what is done is that first of all usually this signaling would be suppressed even if they go on during the call but usually most of the signaling is done before the call is set up  so common channel signaling works very fine some of the bits in the frames are used for this purpose that means that finally  even your analog signal is converted to digital signals and you make a frame out of it  you could stuff this frame with some extra bits for this control purpose ss7  signaling system 7  is a widely accepted standard and this is slowly spreading ; this is a complex standard  refer slide time  43  57  46  39  but this is slowly spreading now whether in band or out of band  logically  the switch controllers may be considered to be in an overlay network in the control plane that means  you have all the switches through which the actual connection is taking place but then you have some switch controllers  which will actually give instructions to this switch  to switch in a particular fashion  or maybe do some billing  etc there is a network of switch controllers ; first of all  there is this network of subscribers that are connected through their voice set or may be through modem  etc  all over so that is the primary service-giving network but overlaid on this same network  you have these switch controllers at various points who are talking to each other for giving all these services and they are using the same network so this is some kind of an overlay network over the basic network that we have there are all kinds of extra services being given these days for example  you know that nowadays where ever ss7 or any other advanced signaling system is there  you can get the caller id that means if your local exchange supports it  who ever is the caller  his id  that means his telephone number  will appear in your hand set so that even before you answer  you know who it is that is calling and then you may choose not to answer his call anyway  you can make a note of it now how is that done ? the numbers that he dialed at his end ? circuit has been set up there and not only that  because the local exchange has to know the source number  the source number is also transmitted and finally fed to the receiver ? s end so that he gets the caller id number so all kinds of intelligent services are being given these days this is the signaling system 7 and there is an out of band signaling  which is different from in band signaling that means in out of band  for signaling purpose  a separate channel is always earmarked so they do not interfere with this regular channel at all so this is more flexible as it allows arbitrarily complex message transfer  refer slide time  46  39  48  43  so this is a state diagram ? a very rough diagram ? of the kind of states that the system goes through when a call is being made first of all  it is quiescent that means it is not doing anything then you take the receiver off the hook nowadays of course telephone services have improved tremendously ; otherwise  you would have noticed that the moment you take it off the hook and the moment you get the dialing tone there may be a gap actually these two are not the same thing  you pull it off the hook  which gives a signal to the local exchange that you want to make a call and the local exchange then finds some resource to serve you and when it finds the resource to serve you  it gives you a dial tone so when you get the dial tone  you know that the local exchange is ready to receive the numbers that you dial then you will dial some numbers and you have to wait for some time for the call to be set up if it is simply a local call  it may be a small fraction of a time ; if it is a long-distance call  you may have to wait for some time  for some appreciable time  when the call is being set up so  of course  the hand set on the other side starts ringing but that is not the ring that you hear when the local switch knows that the entire path has been set up  it sends the signal  which comes as the ringing noise to your phone so you know that the other side the line must have been set up and then they start talking the other side will also go off the hook and then they start talking and they will disconnect and at the time of disconnection  you want to know how much to bill this person  etc so we will quickly go through this control plane protocols of ss 7 i will just mention some names  for example  names of some elements ? you know that this is the very huge area   refer slide time  48  56  49  17  this software development for a telecom so these are some of the elements which are there in ss 7  application service element  that is application level functionality such as interpreting signaling messages  then the transaction capabilities  which allow systems to invoke procedure calls on remote machines   refer slide time  49  17  49  36  signaling connection control part sccp  connections  sequence numbering  segmentation  reassembly  flow control  etc some of these terms may not make any sense at the moment so we will discuss this later on in other context then there is a message transfer part3  part2   refer slide time  49  37 49  52  and part 1 one of the main applications of ss 7 is the telephone user part  which is responsible for setting up voice calls the tup interprets dialed digits  routes  reserves resources  and maintains accounts etc  refer slide time  49  53  50  19  now we will take a quick look at the digital technology in the telephone network as mentioned earlier  traditionally everything was analog then the exchanges started getting converted to digital technology  so a device called a codec is used to convert analog voice signals into digital information that can be handled by digital technology  refer slide time  50  19  50  47  the codec is also used to convert the digital signals back into analog on the other side  so that voice signals that can be handled by the older analog technology now most of the telephone network is digital ; only the local loop is still mostly analog there have been attempts to make this digital also and one of the items was this integrated service digital network  the so-called isdn let us take a quick look at isdn  refer slide time  50  48  52  07  isdn was envisaged as an end-to-end digital service ; that means it starts as a digital service from the user ? s premise and goes straight that way as a digital service right to the other end now home users would be connected by the same category 3 cables ; that was important because people are already connected by cat 3 cables and it is a very difficult and costly proposition to change all that cabling so the idea was to use the same category 3 cables for this new digital service there would be some kind of network termination on the end so there were two rates ; one was the basic rate  which was the 2b + d or 144 kbps ; 2 b means 2 voice channel of 64 kbps each  so that is 128 kbps ; and 1 d channel that is for the control purpose so you could do out-of-band signaling over here of 16 kbps  giving you a total of 144 kbps that is the basic rate for isdn for higher users  you have a primary rate equivalent to e 1  so there are 30 channels for this  maybe voice channels  and 1d channel  etc  for an e 1 line  there is some thing else in usa ; that we will see later  refer slide time  52  08  52  25  the system uses out-of-band signaling and uses the d channel for that nt1 is the network terminating device  which connects to the isdn exchange on one side and a local passive bus on the other  refer slide time  52  26  52  33  for larger users we have another kind of termination called nt 2 the isdn turned out to be very expensive  which was a problem isdn was originally envisaged as a very broadband service with voice data  etc on this same isdn  but unfortunately  because of historical and technological reasons  the isdn turned out to be quite expensive so  although it was deployed in some places ? it is also deployed some places in india and a lot of places in europe ? since it was so expensive  it did not become popular so that was the problem with isdn ; so people thought about an altogether new technology called atm and we will discuss atm later  refer slide time  53  12  53  34  another direction  in which this digitizing the local loop went  was the digital subscriber loop or dsl so it had two basic approaches  one was that for the large user  let us say  a particular office or company you can take a fiber to the premise of that company  which can be integrated like a sort of outlet and you can give all kinds of services ? that is one thing the other is to use the same category-3 cable ? maybe different bands of it using some advanced technology of multiplexing signals and then give both data and voice at the same time on the same line  refer slide time  54  01  54  07  so you have this remote subscriber terminal  which is connected to the individual users  refer slide time  54  08  54  19  the copper twisted pair remains the same  but the new equipment is integrated  enabling a service provider to deliver voice and high-speed data service at the same time  refer slide time  54  20  54  56  so this is the picture that shows subscribers who are connected through the analog and dsl lines now in the centre of the side  you have some kind of a splitter and in this splitter  one side is the data  one side the data goes through this d slam  which is digital service digital service access multiplexer so that goes maybe to the internet  the other part goes to the voice switch to the pstn  which is the other  plain old previous voice services  refer slide time  54  57  55  22  so dsl at subscriber ? s end has voice traffic that is transmitted as standard analog telephony signals ; data traffic is transmitted over the same line but via a dsl modem that transmits the data as high-frequency digital broadband signals on the same line so if you have dsl modem  you can have both your voice as well as data at the same time  unlike ordinary analog lines  refer slide time  55  23  55  35  so with dsl at the central office end  co end  the signals pass through a splitter as i have shown and a local loop management system  so the subscriber line access multiplexer is there  refer slide time  55  36  55  38   refer slide time  55  39  55  43  you can just have this figure where we have dslam and the loop management over there  refer slide time  55  44  55  56  the broadband digital signals are directed to a dslam that terminates and coordinates traffic from multiple local loop lines  from the dslam the traffic is sent to a router and then to the internet and finally we have the loop management system   refer slide time  56  03  which may be in front of the splitter or behind the splitter so this performs various functions as they are like giving the connections ; testing ; and all these services are done through the local loop management thank you preview of next lecture lecture name # 07 switches  i good day ! so today and in the next next lecture we will be talking about switches  switches are the most important part of computer networks and we will just look into some aspects of the different types of switches ; so first in this lecture we will start with the some kind of switches which are used in the telecom networks then there is special special version of these which we will cover in a later lecture and then in the next lecture we will be talking about packet switches which are closer to the heart of data networks so we talk about switches first thing is why do we need switches well ? ? ? ? ?  refer slide time  57  29  58  05  the problem is that each user can potentially call any other user as we have seen in telephone networks so and we can not have direct lines we can not have order in square kind of lines so every user is connected to a essentially a switch in the switching office and switches establish temporary circuits that is they establish a temporary connection between the caller and the collie at the switching station and switching system comes in two parts one is the switch and the other is the switch controller  refer slide time  58  06  you see this fellow say zero zero zero zero wants to talk to zero zero zero one so he will simply go like this and similarly another another line over here may wants to go straight down to somewhere over here so many calls can go through together but this is not always the case now always the case as there may be contention for the same switching element as we will see in this diagram you know because if if you produce something in very large number you can ammonites the cost of its development etc.over a large number of switches so this cost of this switch comes down so ethernet switches have become very cheap these days a switch which use to cost may be lack or so may be 10,15 years back cost only few 1000 rupees today so this is the most common type of switch which we see every where
