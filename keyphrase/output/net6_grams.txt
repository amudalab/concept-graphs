introduction to routing
start our discussion
discussion on routing
talked about routing
context of atm
atm virtual path
set up today
area of routing
specially with reference
packets are routed
start the introduction
introduction with routing
set of lectures
data from end-to-end
source to destination
number of intermediate
subnets now depending
connection-oriented or connectionless
talking about routing
virtually connection oriented
connection oriented system
unlike data link
data link layer
information you require
unlike the data
problem with routing
hops to reach
reach the end
hops the area
globally the packet
packet will arrive
basic routing problem
final destination determine
determined for individual
internetwork these days
network of networks
spanning the entire
billions of machines
objective of routing
reduce the problem
machines are grouped
reach your destination
destination network finding
reached the correct
correct destination network
network the entire
required is structured
table of router
reduce the scope
problem from servers
servers or pcs
pcs to networks
millions of networks
millions of entries
process the packets
packets as fast
number of packets
packets are increasing
day by day
packets very fast
require a lot
lot of memory
additionally it consumes
lot of processing
issues in routing
topology changes affect
delay and stability
topology is changing
change the path
affect the delay
problem is scalability
number of interconnected
networks or routers
routers or links
nodes to networks
number of hops
equal in length
equal in cost
incorporate the quality
path when deciding
consists of deciding
deciding the route
update the knowledge
host or lans
connected to router
sort of remote
bit of choice
tables in routers
sitting on router
router c link
router d link
router e link
path for connection
two levels deep
reach the final
destination this means
trees are distributed
table of size
size n including
including the root
maintain this tree
question of forwarding
process of building
building routing tables
packet and sending
router this means
packet actually arrives
routing or forwarding
two are diverged
assume that routing
routing and forwarding
case forwarding requires
forwarding requires access
access to local
local routing table
table sometimes forwarding
table is structured
manner than routing
table is optimized
optimized for packet
packet look ups
ups routing table
optimized for routing
table is working
address is version
version four addresses
171.69.245.10 the link
part of setting
add your data-link
slightly higher level
view of processing
protocol which makes
makes this table
transmission layer protocol
common transmission layer
transmission layer protocols
tcp and udp
destination ip address
hop and send
send the datagram
discussing the processing
layer is present
two different places
router the jobs
drop that packet
router the forwarding
originates from machine
send the packet
high level view
host the main
forwarding is enabled
enabled on router
router and disabled
disabled on host
datagram is received
forwarding is disabled
collection of lans
lans or point-to-point
links or switched
connected by routers
link layer view
reach the local
router will decide
network of ethernet
networks the packet
link layer point
point of view
switches become visible
number we represent
delivery service takes
takes the view
view of clouds
clouds and ignores
ignores the data
view that means
means the details
networks are shown
shown as clouds
clouds each network
conditions must hold
delivered the network
address must correspond
unique data link
link layer network
equal to lan
lan or point-to-point
link or switched
network the reverse
basically four numbers
make the problem
problem really big
reduction or scaling
specific ip addresses
addresses of specific
first few bits
bits or bytes
last few bits
global ip addressing
prefix the network
unique because now-a-days
now-a-days our network
span the entire
true which means
means one data
two different network
routers and hosts
common network prefix
exchange ip datagrams
link layer protocol
router and host
table which tells
tells the router
process an outgoing
packet the main
port next hop
hop and interface
column and routing
tables are set
datagram gets closer
table ip datagrams
delivered which means
interface called ethernet
means any number
deliver the datagrams
directly which means
set of networks
packet which originates
network layer protocol
previously we discussed
lot of data
link layer protocols
require some information
exchanged between peers
peers this information
processed the destination
address is parsed
decrement ttl i.e
i.e we decrement
capture a good
good and consistent
consistent and correct
entire global connectivity
picture may change
entire global picture
inconsistent routing table
routing table entries
table the loop
router the router
locally and send
circulating ad infinitum
infinitum to stop
put some kind
kind of restriction
hops a packet
intermediate router forwards
forwards a packet
hops whichever router
whichever router finds
finds a packet
drop the packet
details of fragmentation
