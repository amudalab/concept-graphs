computer networks prof sujoy ghosh iit kharagpur lecture no 1 emergence of networks & reference models  refer slide time  00  36  good day i am professor sujoy ghosh of iit kharagpur  i teach in the computer science and engineering department  i will be taking this course on computer networks we will be having about 40 lectures in the series today  we will start with an introductory lecture  which is about the emergence of computer networks  its brief history  and a little bit about the protocols and reference models  which is an abstract view of computer networks the text books for the course will be these three  computer networking  a top down approach featuring the internet by kurose data and communication by william stallings and computer networks by a s tanenbaum some of the material that we will be covering here verbally as well as in the slides  will be from these books the first question is  what is a computer network ? computer network is a number of computers  also know as nodes  connected by some communication lines we have these computers  which are connected by some communication lines two computers connected to the network can communicate with each other through other nodes if they are not directly connected  which means that computer does not have to be connected to all the other computers in the network in order to communicate with any of them it may be an indirect communication via some other computer and other point is that these nodes are computers but some of them are not computers ; some of them are network devices there are various kinds of network devices like switches  routers etc  so  they facilitate the communication and running of this entire network they are also taken as nodes in the network finally  we have some of the nodes  which may be either computers or they may be network devices like switches and routers and there is a communication between them this communication  refer slide time  1  28 -2  30  can be of various types ? we will come to that presently the computers can communicate with each other what do they communicate ? they exchange information between different computers  this information could be of any kind of information ? they could be data used by a program or they could be some program itself or it could be any kind of information this is one of the basic and major uses of computer networks there are other specialized uses of computer networks for example  interconnected  small computers can replace a large computer for example  you have a very large computation to perform and so for that either you need a very powerful and very large computer  which is very costly the other option could be that you break up this work into very small pieces and assign them to the small computers the small computers do the computation on that small chunk of the problem  and then they communicate with each other to form the final solution the other use of computer networks  which is coming into vogue very much these days  is that you can use this network as a communication tool for example  you can send emails to almost anybody these days  and that is really a very cheap and very fast mode of communication secondly  the computer networks could also be used for direct communication like you could communicate through voice over a computer network  you can communicate through video over a computer network all these different communication is converging into this computer network and nowadays when we talk about the network we do not look upon it just as a computer network it is the bedrock on which  all these computing communication are converging and then you have some applications  which are necessarily of distributed nature for example  railway reservation system ? now obviously if you had a large computer to handle all the railway reservations in the world in one place but we would not want all the people to go to one place and form a huge queue so  we want to distribute this functionality that means what that of booking tickets all over the country these are the examples of distributed systems so this is a distributed reservation system similarly  there could be other kinds of distributed systems  distributed databases and all kinds of applications  so that is the other application of networks  refer slide time  3  30-5  59  now  a quick look at the history of the computers first  then we will focus on computer networks in 1948  we have the first commercial computer installed ; it was a univac ? that was a big company once upon a time  and then in 1958  the first us communication satellite became operational the network always has these two component  one is that you have to have these computers and then you have to have these communication channels and satellite communication is one of the important medium of communication in 1964  we have an airline reservation system  which uses some kind of a packet switching network ; it was proposed by the rand corporation ; and in 1969  arpanet  the first packet switching network began its operation this was actually a water shed event as we will see this have been very far reaching impact on the way computer networks developed  refer slide time  6  51 -8  03  in 1971  we have the first computer chip  previous computers were made through very low level gates and all but the first four-bit small computer chip with 2300 transistors and they became available in 1971 in 1972  ethernet specification was formulated ? this ethernet is one protocol ? and ethernet remains one of the most important network protocols that we use so that was first formulated in 1972 in 1974  ibm introduced its own version of network in sna in 1975  altair 8800  the first commercial microcomputer  was sold as a kit  refer slide time  8  17-09  18  in 1975  we had paul alan and bill gates getting together who eventually formed microsoft in 1976  woznaik and jobs built apple1 so apple also has lot of contribution to make to computers in various aspects and windows system was basically started from apple computers in 1979  we had visicalc first commercial spreadsheet ; this is the popular application of computers these days  refer slide time  09  18  10  07  in 1981  ibm introduced ibm pc with one floppy drive ; later on they changed it with drive and hard drive ; and in 1983  tcp/ip is another network protocol that we are using we use both ethernet and tcp/ip protocol we have different protocols  which we are running on the network and how this different protocols are arranged and how they are used that i will cover today in second part of the lecture so  this tcp/ip is another important protocol that is still very much prevalent today ? that became the official protocol of the arpanet arpanet is the network  which was set up in usa under the drdo and which had a very far-reaching impact on the way the network developed in 1984  apple introduced gui with apple macintosh and 1986 we see the first laptop pcs  refer slide time  10  09 ? 11  07  in 1988  ibm gives a multitasking os for the pcs in 1989  microsoft releases windows  which is yet another multitasking system that is the microsoft version ; in 1989  nsf  national sound foundation of usa replaces arpanet as internet backbone and then www was invented by cern physicist tim burners lee in 1991 so this advent of www  world wide web  made the network very popular there was this kind of positive feedback going on  as it became more popular  more and more people jumped into it  as people showed their interest  so commercial companies also became interested because there would be a market for something in the networks that they do and when the commercial companies developed something  naturally it became more easier to use the network ; they had more functionalities ; so more people became interested  that was the positive loop actually the growth of network in the past decade ? in the 90s ? has been absolutely phenomenal the basic so called killerapp  application which attracted so many people to networks was this www which was invented in 1991  refer slide time  11  08 ? 12  48  in 1992  mosaic released first gui web browser  so that was the web browser ? then netscape became the popular web browser  microsoft had its own version of microsoft explorer  that was an another browser and then it all built up into some kind of a frenzy and in 2000  we had this .com  so-called .com meltdown that means people became absolutely frenzied about the growth of computers and such a frenzy can not go on forever so it has to come to an halt so  it did in 2000 but the development of networks and its utility and importance remains  refer slide time  12  48 ? 13  33  now  let us go to a brief history  more focused on the network itself we were in general talking about the computer scene in mid-1960s  usa ? s department of defense wanted a command and control network that could survive a nuclear attack if something had to survive a nuclear attack then you had to distribute it so that was the one strong reason that we wanted a distributed system and if you have a distributed system  these systems must be able to communicate so that was the seed of this project the subnet should consists of some honeywell 12 kw intermediate message processors so there are some kind of early network devices  which are connected by 64 kbps lines these imps ? intermediate message processors ? are connected to the various computers and the imps themselves were connected by telephone lines from telephone companies  refer slide time  13  34  14  36  later  the imp software was changed to terminal interface processor  which allowed the connection of terminals in the 1970s  nsf setup a machine connected to the arpanet to which other universities could dial up and connect now  this became very important in the sense that many people were interested in this so they upgraded their systems in various ways in mid-1980s nsf built a new backbone to connect with super computing centers to some regional networks its backbone  refer slide time  14  37  15  17  was upgraded to 448 kbps and then to 1.5 mbps fiber backbone  and once this fiber backbone was in place  communication became really fast so it allowed network connection to thousands of universities  research labs  libraries  museums  etc as the growth continued  commercial houses began to notice and to join  the decentralized model began to take hold  refer slide time  15  18 -15  45  as i described earlier  commercial people joined so there was a lot of innovation by a lot of people one of the major driving forces in the computing networks in the past decades or even now may be has been the role of so-called start up companies start-up companies means that some young engineers or some young people who had some very bright idea which they developed to a certain extent and when that was proven and then some big company would possibly buy their company or give them money to get access to this kind of technology there was so many success stories that a lot of people got interested in it and when a lot of people think about a problem  there is a lot of innovation so that is how computer networks had an explosive growth in the whole of 90s and even in the 21st century and the growth is going on although the frenzy in the stock exchanges  etc about these .com companies crashed in a 2000 but the growth in the field of networks and its use in various walks of life  is continuing with this brief historical background  now let us come to the networks and some kind of structure or some kind of an abstract view of this computer network i have already mentioned that computer networks will be a number of nodes and nodes could be computers or network devices  which are connected by some communication lines sometimes things are not so simple ; sometimes you have a line between two nodes  giving us point-to-point communication that means one node a is communicating directly to one another node b  where a and b are connected by a direct line  it could be physically a copper line or fiber line  etc this point-to-point connection could be the simplest case but actually it is dedicated and in the dedicated case also we have some different cases for example  you could have simplex communication ; it means that communication can go in only one direction in that line it could be half duplex  it means the communication could go both ways either way from a to b or from b to a  but only in one direction at a time  and full duplex  that a and b can communicate with each other simultaneously  in parallel  at the same time so that means there is communication from a to b and b to a at the same time .these are some different kinds of dedicated lines then if the nodes are not computers  some network devices  specifically  if they are multiplexers  we could share a point to point medium that means there is one line from a to b but a is connected to a lot of other nodes say  a1  a2  to an and b is connected again to a lot of other nodes say  b1  b2 to bn and they could all these ais and bis could communicate through this one single line  which is between a and b  this we will see later how such a thing can be done this business of sharing a link over time or whatever even parallely sometimes it is possible sharing this link by multiple people is called multiplexing these are the different kinds of point-to-point links but point-to-point links are not the only things we have for example we could have a broadcast kind of link ? if we have a satellite communication  satellite throws its signal all over the country or may be all over the region that is something  which is being broadcast so you can not really put it down as a point-to-point link between something  but you could use that shared medium and a broadcast in some way to make temporary point-to-point links or your application may be such that you want to broadcast something for example  we broadcast tv signals ; similarly there are things  which we want to broadcast all over this broadcast media can be dedicated to some users or it could be shared ; that means it is shared between multiple users there the term used is multiple access medium  to which different users are connected at different points and it is a broadcast kind of medium in a distributed fashion  they have some protocol of deciding how to share this because if it is in the same place  the business of sharing becomes somewhat easier so you can multiplex it if nodes themselves are physically distributed over the broadcast medium you will have some kind of protocol called multiple access so you can have a shared broadcast medium also ; that is quite common finally  we have something which is in between broadcasting and point-to-point  which is called multicasting  this means that if we have a group  i have  say  some friends and i want to send some things not to one particular friend but to my group of friends and to no others ? so multicasting is basically communicating to a specified group  refer slide time  15  46  22  21  using such communication link  we have this computer networks networks are divided into local area network  metropolitan area network  and wide area network local area network means that it is local  limited to maybe one building or small group of buildings so its size is small there are some other things about local area network  which make the issues of local area network somewhat different from a larger area network and the local area network usually could be privately owned now how does ownership come into picture ? ownership comes into picture because if you have the same owner for the entire network then you can have the same policy  which is not the case in wide area network in wide area network there may be various nodes which are connected to this wide area network the nodes may belong to very different people and they may have very different ideas about what should be done and all their policies that makes wide area networking somewhat different from local area networking metropolitan area network means a network which is spread over a community or may be even a city  their size is bigger than local area networks and one of the issues which is very important is the access issues  which means that how do you connect ? for example  you want to make the entire community networked ; so how do you connect each one of them because they are geographically more distributed then a local area network local area network may be sometimes we would use validers or sometimes we would just simply draw valve and the cost will not be very prohibitive but in local area how we connect the people becomes an issue that is the access issues we have talked about the wide area network wide area networks are costly they are communicating over may be hundreds or thousands of kilometers the communication is costly  the cost has come down and that is another thing  which has historically happened as more and more people got interested in network  technology developed that is one side of the issue the other side of the issue is that volumes went up ; which means that the number of people who used network so as the volumes went up the cost went down so the technology improved in one direction that was one input into bringing down the cost and the other issue was that more and more people started using it so the volume to a particular company developing something in the network area went up and they could make things cheaper and as the whole thing became cheaper and cheaper  more and more people wanted to join the network wide area network cost is still an issue wide area network  may connect various local area networks  so its a network of networks or internetwork or internet  refer slide time  22  26  26  17  let us look at the abstract idea about the networks in general in formal framework  we have what are known as protocols  why do we need protocols in network ? we need protocols in networks because networks by their very nature  might connect various different people as i said various different people may have very different ideas about how things have to be done if people have different ideas about how things have to be done then they have to agree on some common basis to communicate and this common basis is the protocol there are numbers of protocols  which are used in network and we will be getting into that you and i may have very different ideas about how some particular thing may be done i may be doing this in a certain way and you may be doing the same thing maybe in a completely different way but if we want to communicate we have to agree on some minimum protocol these protocols are the building blocks of this network architecture so each protocol object has two different interfaces ? one is the service interface that defines the operations on this protocol and peer to peer interface which defines messages exchanged with peer for example  any protocol  a protocol is between peers so if in this diagram there are the two lis are the peers and they communicate with each other through this peer interface ; that is the protocol this protocol is supposed to achieve something  supposed to do something for this it requires something maybe from some other called layer actually we have a layered architecture  i am coming to that in the next slide how this protocol is to be invade etc for this we have a service interface and between the peers we have a peer interface  refer slide time  26  18 to 28  50  we have all these different layers  we have this n + 1 th layer  n th layer and n ? 1 th layer how they are to be layered ? about that also there are some standards and we just look at two of them at least for example  this networking business is broken up into whatever the jobs you have to do for achieving for smooth functioning of computer networks we break them up into different functionalities and these functionalities are in different layers this is all in one place  that means in one node similarly  another node  which is connected to the network  will have its own layers and at the same level n and n here they are peers so there will be a protocol between this n and n  there will be a service interface between n + 1 th layer and n th layer similarly  there may be a service interface between n th layer and n ? 1 th layer and so on  refer slide time  28  51 -30  02  so let us see what they are like as i said most networks are organized as series of layers the task of each layer is to give some service to the upper layer and any layer maintains a virtual connection with the corresponding layer in a peer any layer maintains a virtual connection ; this virtual connection is used for running the peer-to-peer protocol  whereas this is the service interface the task of each layer ? each layer performs certain subtask of this whole networking business  so each layer performs some task ? is a service to the upper layer similarly for performing this task  it may break it up into some subtask and some subtask may be delegated to a lower layer this layer could have its own service interface to the lower layer whereas its own task  assuming that the subtask is done by the lower layer  is performed at the peer-to-peer level  using the corresponding protocol  refer slide time  30  03  31  15  there is peer-to-peer protocol running between any two corresponding and communicating layers the interface between the layers in the same node is well defined another point is that for this peer-to-peer protocol mostly they go through a virtual connection what is a virtual connection ? virtual connection means that physical connection ; we understand let us say two computers are connected by wire it is not necessary that two computers have to be directly connected in order to communicate ; it may be an indirect connection also that means it is going from one computer to another then  it is hopping from node to node then  it is finally reaching its destination  and so there is no direct physical communication when you are surfing the internet  you have been connected to some computer  which may be connected to opposite part of the globe so  to you it appears that you are directly connected to that computer so whenever you are clicking something over here  something happens so that clicking of the mouse somehow that gets communicated to that remote web server and may be the page changes or something there seems to be a direct communication but this communication is only virtual the physical communication is only at the lowest layer  where physically something is connected by a piece of wires or fiber optic links or by satellite links whatever it is  that is the physical connection for running all these protocols  these peers need to communicate and this communication is through virtual connection this is the main point of having this layer architecture  that the implementation of each layer  each node is transparent to the other two nodes as i said  i may want to do this one particular subtask in some particular way ? i means some company x ? and then some company y wants to do the same thing in a different way now you need not stop any of them so long as they agree on the protocol  so long as they agree on the service layers what is the service interface between the different layers ? because upper layer service may be given by some product of some company  whereas the lower layer may be developed by some other company once again if they can decide on the interface between these two layers  then they are very free to do it in their own way the same thing applies to the peers for example say two particular layers in two particular nodes may be peers  these nodes are computers themselves now  one may be an ibm machine another may be a sun machine and they will have different operating system  they will have different processors etc but so far as the peer to peer protocol is concerned  they agree so these are the messages i will send and then if i am expecting these kinds of answer  these kinds of messages  i will accept and these kind of answer will be given etc  so that is how a protocol goes so long as they agree on this protocol  these two companies are free to develop their product in their own way and when you allow that naturally  people can innovate  people can put in different things so long as you are conforming to the standards of the protocols and the interfaces  etc  you can develop your own thing in your own way and that is really good for the development of the entire network the other point is that this is one way of abstracting out all these unnecessary details for example any of this network operating system in a computer or a networking device  they may be very complex indeed some of the complexity is special to the implementer one implementer has decided to implement something in a particular way and that will have a whole lot of details we are not really interested in that one  we have to abstract out of that we concentrate on these protocols and the interfaces and the functionalities ; that gives us a fairly general picture about the entire networking  how networking is done and then if you go into the business of developing some of these modules yourself  then you have to go into some more nuts and bolts about how this service can be given the protocols between the peer layers can be changed if the peers all agree naturally if you are changing the protocol  all the peers have to agree ; otherwise the communication will breakdown however  it need not be referred to other layers ? so that is another good thing about layering ; that is whatever change i make it will not matter and the service definition says what the layer does and nothing else  means nothing about the specifics of implementation  which may vary from one vendor to another the interface tells the process about how to access it ; it specifies what the parameters are and what results can be expected  refer slide time  31  16 ? 37  57  we have mentioned the three layered models  the most famous is the osi reference model which we will look into in some detail and then tcp/ip reference model which is most widely used osi reference model mean some part of it is very somewhat theoretical because many people really do not do that and it is that they do not consider that part to be very important tcp/ip reference model is something which is almost ubiquitous and of course there is atm  it is one networking technology which is rather complex technology ; as i mentioned here just as an example ; so that is another kind of reference model there are all kinds of different reference models  sometimes these models are basically a description of the different layers that are there ; and naturally if you talk about the layers  what the layer is supposed to do and that is what you see and then how it is to be interfaced with the layer above and layer below since this is number of layers  one on top of other  they are also referred to as stacks we call about this as tcp/ip stacks  osi stacks  atm stacks and so on other protocol stacks exits and new ones are possible however the extent to which a particular model is universally accepted is the key to its success as i said a lot of thought went into osi reference model but in practice tcp/ip became much more prevalent  refer slide time  37  58-39  36  osi reference model has seven layers and these layers are ; application layer  the presentation layer  the session layer  the network layer  the data link layer and the physical layer  which means that in order that people can communicate over this network in a very seamless manner  all the jobs that are involved have been broken down into seven parts so they are different layers ? application layer is something and then presentation  session  network  data link and physical layer each layer has some kind of functionality and all these functionalities together give you the overall functionality in the network  refer slide time  39  37-40  24  little bit more about peer-level communication  messages sent from one application to another application on different host  travels down to the layers of the sending machine and each layer adds a header to be used by its corresponding peer level and the bottom layer  which is the physical layer  sends the message to the tcp machine ; this is the general scheme the point is that suppose we start something at the very top  in the case of osi  we call it the application layer some communication has been initiated at the application layer this application layer  mind you  has its peer in the destination machine in the destination machine also some application layer program is running for example let us say you are doing a telnet kind of thing  that means you are logging on to another machine  telnet to another machine so you will start a telnet program  which is your telnet client program and the destination machine will respond to a telnet client who will respond to telnet client ; only a telnet server can respond to a telnet client telnet server is under the remote machine these are the two modules which are in the application layer how telnet is an example of a protocol ? this is an application layer protocol and what this protocol does  how the telnet client will request and how the telnet server will respond etc are the internals of telnet protocol so far as the telnet client or any of these application program is concerned ? when it tries to communicate with another application program in another machine ? it just knows about this protocol and how things have to be done at that layer but how this communication be able to go from this machine to another machine ? for this  if you put the whole thing in the same program that becomes very complicated ; that was the idea of layering so give him a virtual connection  he will communicate to the target machine  he will have some data to send that will add up maybe to other kinds of data and then hand it over to the lower layer in the same node the lower layer may be running a protocol with the corresponding layer in the remote machine for that protocol it needs to do communication  for that communication what ever message has to be sent here that gets added to the original data  which was sent by the application layer as the message to be sent moves down the stack from the originating machine at each layer  each layer is running its own protocol with its peer and it has some message to add to give to his pair so  they will keep on adding it to this and this becomes fatter and fatter as it goes down as it goes down to the physical layer  there it can communicate to the remote machine and in the remote machine this is now again moved up the stack and at each layer that particular program or whatever that module in that layer  he will pick out the message which has been sent by its peer in the source this is how communication will go on for all these protocols  refer slide time  40  25-44  06  sending a message is received on the receiving side  then passed up through each layer and each layer reads the corresponding header that means the corresponding header which has been sent by its own peer on the source machine  refer slide time  44  11-44  32  for example  we have two machines  and one machine is a dos machine that means some dos is an old operating system which used to run on the pcs and this was microsoft dos  pc dos  ibm dos  etc and macintosh was a different company as i mentioned so  these two can still communicate  that means two different machines but this original data which was originated from the application layer there is the presentation layer and this presentation layer will add its own header to the original data this whole thing becomes data for the next layer  namely  the session layer session layer will add its own header so as i said  that the original data becomes fatter and fatter and fatter till it comes to the physical layer at the physical layer  data is actually sent in one hop  to the destination machine here  as this whole fat packet travels up  each layer will strip off its corresponding header which is coming from its peer in the source that is how the each of the peers can communicate and each of them has a virtual connection with the destination machine  although the actual connection is the physical connection  refer slide time  44  34-46  07  these are the seven protocol layers and now we are going bottom up first is the physical link  which is how to transmit the bits then we have the data link layer ? that is how to transmit frames now what is the difference between transmitting bits and transmitting frames ? we will see to that ; but a data link basically is a direct connection that is  how two computers which are directly connected or two nodes which are directly connected to each other how they will communicate is the matter of data link computers need not be directly connected to each other in order to communicate ; they have to be connected to the network if there are two machines a and b or two nodes a and b which wants to communicate and there is no direct link between a and b  so it may go as c d e and then b now  how do you know you have to go through c d and e and then to reach b ? somebody has to keep track of the route how to route the packets over the entire network ? that is the job of the network layer then there is the transport layer that is how to send packets to the application packet is some data which has been segregated and put into a packaged together but the original application layer need not have any concept of packet ; somebody has to packetize all these data and there are may be other functions in the transport layer that is they make packets out of the data given by the upper layer  this is a transport layer the session layer  which manages the virtual connection between in the application layer it manages the virtual connection the presentation layer that means how we encode and decode messages that means two different machines may have two different ways of encoding things so  that is the job of the presentation layer as well as the security comes here application  so whatever the actual job the human user is interested in comes in the application layer  refer slide time  46  08-48  42  the application layer contains a variety of protocols ; it depends on what you are trying to do the various users may want to do various things ; examples are ; ftp  telnet  smtp  http etc so these are names of some protocolsm by the ftp protocol  what u can do is you can download files from another machine  by http  you can look at web pages  surf etc and smtp is used for sending mails you may not have come across these protocols directly but the point is whenever you are sending a mail  let us say from a unix machine or something  you are using the smtp protocol  so smtp protocol has been built into that similarly  even if you are telneting that means the telnet sever  telnet client etc  they will be there in the machine as part of the os so  the application layer usually  request reliable and cheap connection to its peer that is what the application layer is concerned about  that it must be connected reliably and cheaply to its peer some examples of peers we have given some nodes given service etc  refer slide time  48  43-50  00  application layer hands this  whatever it has to send to the presentation layer which handles the format of the data  protocol conversion  data translation with its ascii or may be some other big or something and data compression  data encryption  these are handled in the presentation layer  refer slide time  50  00-50  22  in the session layer  it allows the application on different computers to share a connection we will see about this connection later on i go to the next layer we will see that i will packetize this data but then so far as the user is concerned  he wants a continuous connection this connection is handled in the session layer so it can provide check points ; that is if there is come disruption  you can come back to it and get the original state back and then you can retransmit if there is some distance ? dialogue control  who can transmit etc  refer slide time  50  22-51  01  the transport layer  the basic function of the transport layer is to accept data from the layer above  split it into smaller units if necessary now  why we need to split ? that we will come to later on so these are the packets pass these to the network layer and ensure that the pieces all arrive correctly and in the right order at the other end for example  you have chopped them into pieces ; they may have become out of order that is the business of the transport layer that should also be done in a cheap and efficient manner and etc and the same thing applies  refer slide time  51  01-51  33  there may be different types of transport services  there may be multiple protocols here one could be error-free  point-to-point channels or it could be a very cheap kind of channel or broadcasting of messages to multiple destinations so these are the different types of transport service  which are possible  refer slide time  51  33-51  56  network layer decides on what route to take locally  so that the intended message ultimately reaches the destination it controls the broadcasting by essentially segregating the different networks  etc it handles technological mismatches so we will get into the details of this later on  refer slide time  51  56-52  12  it does congestion control  it handles billing information etc  refer slide time  52  12-52  20  the data link layer makes the physical link layer appear like a channel that is free of transmission errors actually in the physical layer there may be error but the data link layer handles this error correction etc at the very lowest level  refer slide time  52  20-52  33  finally  at the lowest level we have the physical layer  where the data is actually transmitted as raw bits  etc  refer slide time  52  3-52  41  the other layer is tcp/ip reference model  where the session and presentation layer are not there we have the application layer  transport layer  network layer or maybe something like the data link or the physical layer  refer slide time  52  22-52  52  so the rough correspondence is something like this ; we have the tcp/ip model where we have just this few and we have the osi reference model with so many so more or less  they match the essential functions match there are other kinds of protocols  which are also used but the tcp/ip and osi  are the most common in the next class  we will be discussing the different structures of networks so  today we just had an abstract view of networks and in the next class we will handle different structures  refer slide time  52  52-53  25  preview computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh iit kharagpur lecture 2 network topology  refer slide time  53  57  good day in this lecture we will discuss the network topology now what do you mean by a network topology ?  refer slide time  54  00-55  20  we just have a quick recap of what we had learnt last time  basically a computer network  could be a number of nodes which are connected by some communication links there is some kind of graph  this graph has certain structure so when we talk about the structure  this structure has an implication about how will go about communicating as i said it is in general not feasible to have one to one communication between each pair of nodes that is not possible at all  so what kind of structure ? that is why the nodes connected in each manner is the subject matter of our discussion today a network may be represented as a graph  nodes representing computers or network devices like switches  routers etc and the links represent communication links modes of communication may be broadcast or point to point we have discussed this  refer slide time  55  25 ? 55  35  first let us talk about the lan topologies lan  the local area network and the local area network topologies are three they are very common ; star  ring and a bus refer slide time  55  49 ? 57  20  first of all  we first take up this bus topology and why do you take up a bus topology ? this a very simple kind of network which is based on a shared broadcast links we still want to look at point to point communication  that means there may be so many nodes a  b  c  d  etc  which are connected to the network and a wants to communicate to b so c  d  e are connected but a specifically wants to communicate to b each pair of communicating nodes used a link for the short time so  a uses the link for the short time to send his message to b then may be c might sends something to b or something like that other nodes ignore the communication since  this is shared broadcast link all the nodes get the communication  that is not private in that sense all the nodes get that communication but they usually ignore this communication whereas b will copy this for its own purpose now  they has to be a distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link there has to be some protocol otherwise if a wants to communicate with b and b wants to communicate c  as c wants to communicate with d their communications will go and collide in that shared broadcast medium  so the communication of both the pairs of node will get garbled so by that i mean and sometimes actually that would happen that things will get garbled but that is not what we
