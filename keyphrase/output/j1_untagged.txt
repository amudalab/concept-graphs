system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers while less common  java applets run in secure  sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications and can be embedded in html pages writing in the java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a java virtual machine  jvm  ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages  including ada  javascript  python  and ruby in addition  several languages have been designed to run natively on the jvm  including scala  clojure and groovy java syntax borrows heavily from c and c + +  but object-oriented features are modeled after smalltalk and objective-c  11  java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where every object is allocated on the heap and all variables of object types are references memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the jvm on november 13  2006  sun

references 9 external links platform  edit  the java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the java programming language the platform is not specific to any one processor or operating system  rather an execution engine  called a virtual machine  and a compiler with a set of libraries are implemented for various hardware and operating systems so that java programs can run identically on all of them there are multiple platforms  each targeting a different class of devices  java card  a technology that allows small java-based applications  applets  to be run securely on smart cards and similar small-memory devices java me  micro edition   specifies several different sets of libraries  known as profiles  for devices with limited storage  display  and power capacities often used to develop applications for mobile devices  pdas  tv set-top boxes  and printers java se  standard edition   for general-purpose use on desktop pcs  servers and similar devices java ee  enterprise edition   java se plus various apis useful for multi-tier client – server enterprise applications the java platform consists of several programs  each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities for example  the java compiler  which converts java source code into java bytecode  an intermediate language for the jvm   is provided as part of the java development kit  jdk   the java runtime environment  jre   complementing the jvm with a just-in-time  jit  compiler  converts intermediate bytecode into native machine code on the fly an extensive set of libraries are also part of the java platform the essential components in the platform are the java language compiler  the libraries  and the runtime environment in which java intermediate bytecode executes according to the rules laid out in the virtual machine specification java virtual machine  edit  main article  java virtual machine the heart of the java platform is the concept of a " virtual machine " that executes java bytecode programs this bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running under there is a jit  just in time  compiler within the java virtual machine  or jvm the jit compiler translates the java bytecode into native processor instructions at run-time and caches the native code in memory during execution the use of bytecode as an intermediate language permits java programs to run on any platform that has a virtual machine available the use of a jit compiler means that java applications  after a short delay during loading and once they have " warmed up " by being all or mostly jit-compiled  tend to run about as fast as native programs  citation needed  since jre version 1.2  sun 's jvm implementation has included a just-in-time compiler instead of an interpreter although java programs are cross-platform or platform independent  the code of the java virtual machines  jvm  that execute these programs is not every supported operating platform has its own jvm class libraries  edit  main article  java class library in most modern operating systems  oss   a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer 's job this code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime because the java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system  applications can not rely on any of the pre-existing os libraries instead  the java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing much of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems most of the system library is also written in java for instance  swing library paints the user interface and handles the events itself  eliminating many subtle differences between how different platforms handle even similar components the java class libraries serve three purposes within the java platform first  like other standard code libraries  the java libraries provide the programmer a well-known set of functions to perform common tasks  such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing second  the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily intertwined with the distinctive implementations of each platform the java.net and java.io libraries implement an abstraction layer in native os code  then provide a standard interface for the java applications to perform those tasks finally  when some underlying platform does not support all of the features a java application expects  the class libraries work to gracefully handle the absent components  either by emulation to provide a substitute  or at least by providing a consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature languages  edit  see also  list of jvm languages and jvm programming languages the word " java "  alone  usually refers to java programming language that was designed for use with the java platform programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase " platform "  although the java programming language was listed as a core part of the java platform before java 7 the language and runtime were therefore commonly considered a single unit however  an effort was made with the java 7 specification to more clearly treat the java language and the java virtual machine as separate entities  so that they are no longer considered a single unit  14  third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the jvm some of these are for existing languages  while others are for extensions to the java language these include  beanshell  a lightweight scripting language for java  15  clojure  a dialect of the lisp programming language groovy  a dynamic language with features similar to those of python  ruby  perl  and smalltalk jruby  a ruby interpreter jython  a python interpreter kotlin  an industrial programming language for jvm with full java interoperability rhino  a javascript interpreter scala  a multi-paradigm programming language designed as a " better java "  gosu  a general-purpose java virtual machine-based programming language released under the apache license 2.0 similar platforms  edit  see also  comparison of the java and .net platforms and comparison of c # and java the success of java and its write once  run anywhere concept has led to other similar efforts  notably the .net framework  appearing since 2002  which incorporates many of the successful aspects of java .net in its complete form  microsoft 's implementation  is currently only fully available on windows platforms  whereas java is fully available on many platforms .net was built from the ground-up to support multiple programming languages  while the java platform was initially built to support only the java language  although many other languages have been made for jvm since .net includes a java-like language called visual j #  formerly named j + +  that is incompatible with the java specification  and the associated class library mostly dates to the old jdk 1.1 version of the language for these reasons  it is more a transitional language to switch from java to the .net platform  than a first class .net language visual j # was discontinued with the release of microsoft visual studio 2008 the existing version shipping with visual studio 2005 will be supported until 2015 as per the product life-cycle strategy java development kit  edit  main article  java development kit the java development kit  jdk  is a sun product aimed at java developers since the introduction of java  it has been by far the most widely used java software development kit  sdk    citation needed  it contains a java compiler  a full copy of the java runtime environment  jre   and many other important development tools history  edit  the java platform and language began as an internal project at sun microsystems in december 1990  providing an alternative to the c + + /c programming languages engineer patrick naughton had become increasingly frustrated with the state of sun 's c + + and c application programming interfaces  apis  and tools while considering moving to next  naughton was offered  by whom ?  a chance to work on new technology  and thus the stealth project started the stealth project was soon renamed to the green project  with james gosling and mike sheridan joining naughton together with other engineers  they began work in a small office on sand hill road in menlo park  california they aimed to develop new technology for programming next-generation smart appliances  which sun expected to offer major new opportunities  16  the team originally considered using c + +  but rejected it for several reasons because they were developing an embedded system with limited resources  they decided that c + + needed too much memory and that its complexity led to developer errors the language 's lack of garbage collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system memory  a challenging and error-prone task the team also worried about the c + + language 's lack of portable facilities for security  distributed programming  and threading finally  they wanted a platform that would port easily to all types of devices bill joy had envisioned a new language combining mesa and c in a paper called further  he proposed to sun that its engineers should produce an object-oriented environment based on c + +  initially  gosling attempted to modify and extend c + +  a proposed development that he referred to as " c + + + +  "  but soon abandoned that in favor of creating a new language  which he called oak  after the tree that stood just outside his office  citation needed  by the summer of 1992  the team could demonstrate portions of the new platform  including the green os  the oak language  the libraries  and the hardware their first demonstration  on september 3  1992  focused on building a personal digital assistant  pda  device named star7  1  that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called " duke " to assist the user in november of that year  the green project was spun off to become firstperson  a wholly owned subsidiary of sun microsystems  and the team relocated to palo alto  california  17  the firstperson team had an interest in building highly interactive devices  and when time warner issued a request for proposal  rfp  for a set-top box  firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform however  the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user ; firstperson lost their bid to sgi an additional deal with the 3do company for a set-top box also failed to materialize unable to generate interest within the television industry  the company was rolled back into sun java meets the web  edit  in june and july 1994  after three days of brainstorming with john gage  the director of science for sun  gosling  joy  naughton  wayne rosing  and eric schmidt  the team re-targeted the platform for the world wide web they felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like mosaic the internet could evolve into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable tv as a prototype  naughton wrote a small browser  webrunner  named after the movie blade runner   renamed hotjava  16  in 1995 in 1994 sun renamed the oak language as java after a trademark search revealed that oak technology used the name oak  18  although java 1.0a became available for download in 1994  the first public release of java  java 1.0a2 with the hotjava browser  came on may 23  1995  announced by gage at the sunworld conference accompanying gage 's announcement  marc andreessen  executive vice president of netscape communications corporation  unexpectedly announced that netscape browsers would include java support on january 9  1996  sun microsystems formed the javasoft group to develop the technology  19  version history  edit  main article  java version history the java language has undergone several changes since the release of jdk  java development kit  1.0 on january 23  1996  as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library since j2se 1.4 the java community process  jcp  has governed the evolution of the java language the jcp uses java specification requests  jsrs  to propose and specify additions and changes to the java platform the java language specification  jls  specifies the language ; changes to the jls are managed under jsr 901  20  sun released jdk 1.1 on february 19  1997 major additions included an extensive retooling of the awt event model  inner classes added to the language  javabeans and jdbc j2se 1.2  december 8  1998  — codename playground this and subsequent releases through j2se 5.0 were rebranded java 2 and the version name " j2se "  java 2 platform  standard edition  replaced jdk to distinguish the base platform from j2ee  java 2 platform  enterprise edition  and j2me  java 2 platform  micro edition   major additions included reflection  a collections framework  java idl  an interface description language implementation for corba interoperability   and the integration of the swing graphical api into the core classes a java plug-in was released  and sun 's jvm was equipped with a jit compiler for the first time j2se 1.3  may 8  2000  — codename kestrel notable changes included the bundling of the hotspot jvm  the hotspot jvm was first released in april  1999 for the j2se 1.2 jvm   javasound  java naming and directory interface  jndi  and java platform debugger architecture  jpda   j2se 1.4  february 6  2002  — codename merlin this became the first release of the java platform developed under the java community process as jsr 59  21  major changes included regular expressions modeled after perl  exception chaining  an integrated xml parser and xslt processor  jaxp   and java web start j2se 5.0  september 30  2004  — codename tiger originally numbered 1.5  which is still used as the internal version number  22  developed under jsr 176  tiger added several significant new language features including the for-each loop  generics  autoboxing and var-args  23  java se 6  december 11  2006  — codename mustang bundled with a database manager and facilitates the use of scripting languages with the jvm  such as javascript using mozilla 's rhino engine   as of this version  sun replaced the name " j2se " with java se and dropped the " .0 " from the version number  24  other major changes include support for pluggable annotations  jsr 269   many gui improvements  including native ui enhancements to support the look and feel of windows vista  and improvements to the java platform debugger architecture  jpda  & jvm tool interface for better monitoring and troubleshooting java se 7  july 28  2011  — codename dolphin this version developed under jsr 336 it added many small language changes including strings in switch  try-with-resources and type inference for generic instance creation the jvm was extended with support for dynamic languages  while the class library was extended among others with a join/fork framework   25  an improved new file i/o library and support for new network protocols such as sctp java 7 update 76 was released in january 2015  with expiration date april 14  2015  26  the current version  java se 8  march 18  2014   notable changes include language-level support for lambda expressions  closures  and default methods  the project nashorn javascript runtime  a new date and time api inspired by joda time  and the removal of permgen this version is not officially supported on the windows xp platform  27  however  due to the end of java 7 's lifecycle it is the recommended version for xp users previously  only an unofficial manual installation method had been described for windows xp sp3 it refers to jdk8  the developing platform for java that also includes a fully functioning java runtime environment  28  in addition to language changes  significant changes have been made to the java class library over the years  which has grown from a few hundred classes in jdk 1.0 to over three thousand in j2se 5.0 entire new apis  such as swing and java 2d  have evolved  and many of the original jdk 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated usage  edit  desktop use  edit  according to oracle  the java runtime environment is found on over 850 million pcs  29  microsoft has not bundled a java runtime environment  jre  with its operating systems since sun microsystems sued microsoft for adding windows-specific classes to the bundled java runtime environment  and for making the new classes available through visual j + +   citation needed  apple no longer includes a java runtime with os x as of version 10.7  but the system prompts the user to download and install it the first time an application requiring the jre is launched  citation needed  many linux distributions include the partially compatible free software package gnu classpath  30  and increasingly mostly compatible icedtea some java applications are in fairly widespread desktop use  including the netbeans and eclipse integrated development environments  and file sharing clients such as limewire and vuze java is also used in the matlab mathematics programming environment  both for rendering the user interface and as part of the core system java provides cross platform user interface for some high end collaborative applications like lotus notes mobile devices  edit  java me has become popular in mobile devices  where it competes with symbian  brew  and the .net compact framework the diversity of mobile phone manufacturers has led to a need for new unified standards so programs can run on phones from different suppliers  midp the first standard was midp 1  which assumed a small screen size  no access to audio  and a 32kb program limit the more recent midp 2 allows access to audio  and up to 64kb for the program size with handset designs improving more rapidly than the standards  some manufacturers relax some limitations in the standards  for example  maximum program size google 's android operating system uses the java language  but not its class libraries  therefore the android platform can not be called java android executes the code on the dalvik vm instead of the java vm web server and enterprise use  edit  the java platform has become a mainstay of enterprise it development since the introduction of the enterprise edition in 1998  in two different ways  through the coupling of java to the web server  the java platform has become a leading platform for integrating the web with enterprise backend systems this has allowed companies to move part or all of their business to the internet environment by way of highly interactive online environments  such as highly dynamic websites  that allow the customer direct access to the business processes  e.g online banking websites  airline booking systems and so on   this trend has continued from its initial web-based start  the java platform has matured into an enterprise integration role in which legacy systems are unlocked to the outside world through bridges built on the java platform this trend has been supported for java platform support for eai standards like messaging and web services and has fueled the inclusion of the java platform as a development basis in such standards as sca  xam and others java has become the standard development platform for many companies ' it departments  which do most or all of their corporate development in java this type of development is usually related to company-specific tooling  e.g a booking tool for an airline  and the choice for the java platform is often driven by a desire to leverage the existing java infrastructure to build highly intelligent and interconnected tools the java platform has become the main development platform for many software tools and platforms that are produced by third-party software groups  commercial  open source and hybrid  and are used as configurable  rather than programmable  tools by companies examples in this category include web servers  application servers  databases  enterprise service buses  business process management  bpm  tools and content management systems enterprise use of java has also long been the main driver of open source interest in the platform this interest has inspired open source communities to produce a large amount of software  including simple function libraries  development frameworks  e.g the spring framework  apache wicket  dojo toolkit  hibernate   and open source implementations of standards and tools  e.g apache tomcat  the glassfish application server  the mule and apache servicemix enterprise service buses   mascot  edit  plain ol ' duke duke is java 's mascot  31  when sun announced that java se and java me would be released under a free software license  the gnu general public license   they released the duke graphics under the free bsd license at the same time  32  a new duke personality is created every year  33  for example  in july 2011 " future tech duke " included a bigger nose  a jetpack  and blue wings  34  licensing  edit  the source code for sun 's implementations of java  that is the de facto reference implementation  has been available for some time  but until recently the license terms severely restricted what could be done with it without signing  and generally paying for  a contract with sun as such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the open source initiative or the free software foundation to be considered open source or free software  and sun java was therefore a proprietary platform  35  while several third-party projects  e.g gnu classpath and apache harmony  created free software partial java implementations  the large size of the sun libraries combined with the use of clean room methods meant that their implementations of the java libraries  the compiler and vm are comparatively small and well defined  were incomplete and not fully compatible these implementations also tended to be far less optimized than sun 's  citation needed  free software  edit  see also  openjdk sun announced in javaone 2006 that java would become free and open source software   36  and on october 25  2006  at the oracle openworld conference  jonathan i schwartz said that the company was set to announce the release of the core java platform as free and open source software within 30 to 60 days  37  sun released the java hotspot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the gnu general public license on november 13  2006  with a promise that the rest of the jdk  that includes the jre  would be placed under the gpl by march 2007  " except for a few components that sun does not have the right to publish in distributable source form under the gpl "    38  according to richard stallman  this would mean an end to the " java trap "   39  mark shuttleworth called the initial press announcement  " a real milestone for the free software community "   40  sun released the source code of the class library under gpl on may 8  2007  except some limited parts that were licensed by sun from 3rd parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software and open-source license  41  some of the encumbered parts turned out to be fairly key parts of the platform such as font rendering and 2d rasterising  but these were released as open-source later by sun  see openjdk class library   sun 's goal was to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed-source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source in the meantime  a third party project called icedtea created a completely free and highly usable jdk by replacing encumbered code with either stubs or code from gnu classpath although openjdk has since become buildable without the encumbered parts  from openjdk 6 b10  42    icedtea is still used by the majority of distributions  such as fedora  rhel  debian  ubuntu  gentoo  arch linux and slackware  as it provides security releases and an easier means for patch inclusion openjdk also still does n't include a browser plugin & web start implementation  so icedtea 's companion project  icedtea-web  is needed to fill this gap in june 2008  it was announced that icedtea6  as the packaged version of openjdk on fedora 9  has passed the technology compatibility kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible java 6 implementation  43  because openjdk is under the gpl  it is possible to redistribute a custom version of the jre directly with software applications   44   45  rather than requiring the enduser  or their sysadmin  to download and install the correct version of the proprietary oracle jre onto each of their systems themselves criticism  edit  main article  criticism of java in most cases java support is unnecessary in web browsers  and security experts recommend that it not be run in a browser unless absolutely necessary  46  it was suggested that  if java is required by a few web sites  users should have a separate browser installation specifically for those sites generics  edit  further information  generics in java when generics were added to java 5.0  there was already a large framework of classes  many of which were already deprecated   so generics were chosen to be implemented using erasure to allow for migration compatibility and re-use of these existing classes this limited the features that could be provided by this addition as compared to some other languages  47   48  unsigned integer types  edit  java lacks native unsigned integer types unsigned data are often generated from programs written in c and the lack of these types prevents direct data interchange between c and java unsigned large numbers are also used in many numeric processing fields  including cryptography  which can make java less convenient to use for these tasks  49  although it is possible to partially circumvent this problem with conversion code and using larger data types  it makes using java cumbersome for handling the unsigned data while a 32-bit signed integer may be used to hold a 16-bit unsigned value with relative ease  a 32-bit unsigned value would require a 64-bit signed integer additionally  a 64-bit unsigned value can not be stored using any integer type in java because no type larger than 64 bits exists in the java language if abstracted using functions  function calls become necessary for many operations which are native to some other languages alternatively  it is possible to use java 's signed integers to emulate unsigned integers of the same size  but this requires detailed knowledge of complex bitwise operations  50  floating point arithmetic  edit  while java 's floating point arithmetic is largely based on ieee 754  standard for binary floating-point arithmetic   certain features are not supported even when using the strictfp modifier  such as exception flags and directed roundings — capabilities mandated by ieee standard 754 additionally  the extended precision floating-point types permitted in 754 and present in many processors are not permitted in java  51   52  performance  edit  further information  java performance in the early days of java  before the hotspot vm was implemented in java 1.3 in 2000  there were some criticisms of performance however  benchmarks typically report java as being about two times slower than c  a language which compiles to native code    53   54   55  java 's performance has improved substantially since the early versions  56  performance of jit compilers relative to native compilers has in some optimized tests been shown to be quite similar  56   57   58  java bytecode can either be interpreted at run time by a virtual machine  or it can be compiled at load time or runtime into native code which runs directly on the computer 's hardware interpretation is slower than native execution  and compilation at load time or runtime has an initial performance penalty for the compilation modern performant jvm implementations all use the compilation approach  so after the initial startup time the performance is equivalent to native code security  edit  further information  java security the java platform provides a security architecture  59  which is designed to allow the user to run untrusted bytecode in a " sandboxed " manner to protect against malicious or poorly written software this " sandboxing " feature is intended to protect the user by restricting access to certain platform features and apis which could be exploited by malware  such as accessing the local filesystem  running arbitrary commands  or accessing communication networks in recent years  researchers have discovered numerous security flaws in some widely used java implementations  including oracle 's  which allow untrusted code to bypass the sandboxing mechanism  exposing users to malicious attacks these flaws affect only java applications which execute arbitrary untrusted bytecode  such as web browser plug-ins that run java applets downloaded from public websites applications where the user trusts  and has full control over  all code that is being executed are unaffected on august 31  2012  java 6 and 7 on microsoft windows  mac os x  and linux were found to have a serious security flaw that allowed a remote exploit to take place by simply loading a malicious web page  60  java 5 was later found to be flawed as well  61  on january 10  2013  three computer specialists spoke out against java  telling reuters that it was not secure and that people should disable java jaime blasco  labs manager with alienvault labs  stated that " java is a mess it ’ s not secure you have to disable it "  62  this vulnerability affects java 7 and it is unclear if it affects java 6  so it is suggested that consumers disable it  63   64  security alerts from oracle announce schedules of critical security-related patches to java  65  on january 14  2013  security experts said that the update still failed to protect pcs from attack  66  this exploit hole prompted a response from the united states department of homeland security encouraging users to disable or uninstall java  67  apple blacklisted java in limited order for all computers running its mac os x operating system through a virus protection program  68  adware  edit  the java browser runtime environment has a history of bundling sponsored software to be installed by default during installation and during the updates which roll out every month or so this includes the " ask.com toolbar " that will redirect browser searches to ads and " mcafee security scan plus "   69  redundancy  edit  several authors inline with recent java security and vulnerability issues have called for users to ditch java " once promising  it has outlived its usefulness in the browser  and has become a nightmare that delights cyber-criminals at the expense of computer users "  70  " i think everyone should uninstall java from all their pcs and macs  and then think carefully about whether they need to add it back if you are a typical home user  you can probably do without it if you are a business user  you may not have a choice "  71  update system  edit  java has yet to release an automatic updater that does not require user intervention and administrative rights  72  unlike google chrome  73  and flash player  74  see also  edit  portal icon

class-based  object-oriented   12  and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible it is intended to let application developers " write once  run anywhere "  wora    13  meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without the need for recompilation  14  java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any java virtual machine  jvm  regardless of computer architecture as of 2015  java is one of the most popular programming languages in use   15   16   17   18  particularly for client-server web applications  with a reported 9 million developers  citation needed  java was originally developed by james gosling at sun microsystems  which has since been acquired by oracle corporation  and released in 1995 as a core component of sun microsystems ' java platform the language derives much of its syntax from c and c + +  but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them the original and reference implementation java compilers  virtual machines  and class libraries were originally released by sun under proprietary licences as of may 2007  in compliance with the specifications of the java community process  sun relicensed most of its java technologies under the gnu general public license others have also developed alternative implementations of these sun technologies  such as the gnu compiler for java  bytecode compiler   gnu classpath  standard libraries   and icedtea-web  browser plugin for applets   contents  hide  1 history 1.1 principles 1.2 versions 2 practices 2.1 java

programming language popularity index graph from 2002 to 2015 over the course of a decade java  blue  and c  black  competing for the top position james gosling  mike sheridan  and patrick naughton initiated the java language project in june 1991  19  java was originally designed for interactive television  but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time  20  the language was initially called oak after an oak tree that stood outside gosling 's office later the project went by the name green and was finally renamed java  from java coffee  21  gosling designed java with a c/c + + -style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar  22  sun microsystems released the first public implementation as java 1.0 in 1995  1  it promised " write once  run anywhere "  wora   providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms fairly secure and featuring configurable security  it allowed network and file-access restrictions major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run java applets within web pages  and java quickly became popular the java 1.0 compiler was re-written in java by arthur van hoff to comply strictly with the java 1.0 language specification  23  with the advent of java 2  released initially as j2se 1.2 in december 1998 – 1999   new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms j2ee included technologies and apis for enterprise applications typically run in server environments  while j2me featured apis optimized for mobile applications the desktop version was renamed j2se in 2006  for marketing purposes  sun renamed new j2 versions as java ee  java me  and java se  respectively in 1997  sun microsystems approached the iso/iec jtc 1 standards body and later the ecma international to formalize java  but it soon withdrew from the process  24   25   26  java remains a de facto standard  controlled through the java community process  27  at one time  sun made most of its java implementations available without charge  despite their proprietary software status sun generated revenue from java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the java enterprise system on november 13  2006  sun released much of java as free and open-source software   foss   under the terms of the gnu general public license  gpl   on may 8  2007  sun finished the process  making all of java 's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms  aside from a small portion of code to which sun did not hold the copyright  28  sun 's vice-president rich green said that sun 's ideal role with regard to java was as an " evangelist "   29  following oracle corporation 's acquisition of sun microsystems in 2009-2010  oracle has described itself as the " steward of java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency "   30  this did not prevent oracle from filing a lawsuit against google shortly after that for using java inside the android sdk  see google section below   java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers  game consoles to scientific supercomputers  31  on april 2  2010  james gosling resigned from oracle  32  principles  edit  there were five primary goals in the creation of the java language   14  it must be " simple  object-oriented  and familiar "  it must be " robust and secure "  it must be " architecture-neutral and portable "  it must execute with " high performance "  it must be " interpreted  threaded  and dynamic "  versions  edit  main article  java version history major release versions of java  along with their release dates  jdk 1.0  january 21  1996  jdk 1.1  february 19  1997  j2se 1.2  december

platform  edit  main articles  java  software platform  and java virtual machine java control panel  version 7 one design goal of java is portability  which means that programs written for the java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate runtime support this is achieved by compiling the java language code to an intermediate representation called java bytecode  instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code  but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine  vm  written specifically for the host hardware end users commonly use a java runtime environment  jre  installed on their own machine for standalone java applications  or in a web browser for java applets standardized libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics  threading  and networking a major benefit of using bytecode is porting however  the overhead of interpretation means that interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than programs compiled to native executables would just-in-time  jit  compilers were introduced from an early stage that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime java is platform independent but as the java virtual machine must convert java bytecode into machine language which depends on the operating system being used  it is platform dependent  33  implementations  edit  see also  free java implementations oracle corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the java se platform  following their acquisition of sun microsystems on january 27  2010 this implementation is based on the original implementation of java by sun the oracle implementation is available for microsoft windows  mac os x  linux and solaris because java lacks any formal standardization recognized by ecma international  iso/iec  ansi  or other third-party standards organization  the oracle implementation is the de facto standard the oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions  the java runtime environment  jre  which contains the parts of the java se platform required to run java programs and is intended for end users  and the java development kit  jdk   which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the java compiler  javadoc  jar  and a debugger openjdk is another notable java se implementation that is licensed under the gnu gpl the implementation started when sun began releasing the java source code under the gpl as of java se 7  openjdk is the official java reference implementation the goal of java is to make all implementations of java compatible historically  sun 's trademark license for usage of the java brand insists that all implementations be " compatible "  this resulted in a legal dispute with microsoft after sun claimed that the microsoft implementation did not support rmi or jni and had added platform-specific features of their own sun sued in 1997  and in 2001 won a settlement of us $ 20 million  as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from sun  34  as a result  microsoft no longer ships java with windows platform-independent java is essential to java ee  and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation this environment enables portable server-side applications performance  edit  main article  java performance programs written in java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in c + +   35   36  however  java programs ' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for java 1.1   37  the addition of language features supporting better code analysis  such as inner classes  the stringbuilder class  optional assertions  etc   and optimizations in the java virtual machine  such as hotspot becoming the default for sun 's jvm in 2000 some platforms offer direct hardware support for java ; there are microcontrollers that can run java in hardware instead of a software java virtual machine  and arm based processors can have hardware support for executing java bytecode through their jazelle option automatic memory management  edit  java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle the programmer determines when objects are created  and the java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use once no references to an object remain  the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer 's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed  typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use if methods for a nonexistent object are called  a " null pointer exception " is thrown  38   39  one of the ideas behind java 's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management in some languages  memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack  or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap in the latter case the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer if the program does not deallocate an object  a memory leak occurs if the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated  the result is undefined and difficult to predict  and the program is likely to become unstable and/or crash this can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers  but these add overhead and complexity note that garbage collection does not prevent " logical " memory leaks  i.e  those where the memory is still referenced but never used garbage collection may happen at any time ideally  it will occur when a program is idle it is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object ; this can cause a program to stall momentarily explicit memory management is not possible in java java does not support c/c + + style pointer arithmetic  where object addresses and unsigned integers  usually long integers  can be used interchangeably this allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security as in c + + and some other object-oriented languages  variables of java 's primitive data types are not objects values of primitive types are either stored directly in fields  for objects  or on the stack  for methods  rather than on the heap  as is commonly true for objects  but see escape analysis   this was a conscious decision by java 's designers for performance reasons because of this  java was not considered to be a pure object-oriented programming language however  as of java 5.0  autoboxing enables programmers to proceed as if primitive types were instances of their wrapper class java contains multiple types of garbage collectors by default   citation needed  hotspot uses the parallel scavenge garbage collector however  there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap for 90 % of applications in java  the concurrent mark-sweep garbage collector is sufficient  40  oracle aims to replace cms with the garbage-first collector  g1   syntax  edit  main article  java syntax the syntax of java is largely derived from c + +  unlike c + +  which combines the syntax for structured  generic  and object-oriented programming  java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language  14  all code is written inside classes  and every data item is an object  with the exception of the primitive data types  i.e integers  floating-point numbers  boolean values  and characters  which are not objects for performance reasons unlike c + +  java does not support operator overloading  41  or multiple inheritance for classes  though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces  42  this simplifies the language and aids in preventing potential errors and anti-pattern design java uses comments similar to those of c + +  there are three different styles of comments  a single line style marked with two slashes  //   a multiple line style opened with / * and closed with * /  and the javadoc commenting style opened with / * * and closed with * / the javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the javadoc executable to create documentation for the program example  // this is an example of a single line comment using two slashes / * this is an example of a multiple line comment using the slash and asterisk this type of comment can be used to hold a lot of information or deactivate code  but it is very important to remember to close the comment * / package fibsandlies ; import java.util.hashmap ; / * * * this is an example of a javadoc comment ; javadoc can compile documentation * from this text javadoc comments must immediately precede the class  method  or field being documented * / public class fibcalculator extends fibonacci implements

fibonacci  fibindex  2  ; memoized.put  fibindex  answer  ; return answer ;    examples  edit  hello world  edit  the traditional " hello  world ! " program can be written in java as   43  class helloworldapp  public static void main  string   args   system.out.println  " hello world ! "  ; // prints the string to the console   to compare this to other programming languages see the list of " hello world ! " program examples source files must be named after the public class they contain  appending the suffix .java  for example  helloworldapp.java it must first be compiled into bytecode  using a java compiler  producing a file named helloworldapp.class only then can it be executed  or " launched "  the java source file may only contain one public class  but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access and any number of public inner classes when the source file contains multiple classes  make one class " public " and name the source file with that public class name a class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file the compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file the name of the class file is the name of the class  with .class appended for class file generation  anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class  a $  and an integer the keyword public denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes  or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy the class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located the keyword static in front of a method indicates a static method  which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object static methods can not access any class members that are not also static the keyword void indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller if a java program is to exit with an error code  it must call system.exit   explicitly the method name " main " is not a keyword in the java language it is simply the name of the method the java launcher calls to pass control to the program java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and enterprise javabeans do not use or need a main   method a java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods  which means that the vm needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from the main method must accept an array of string objects by convention  it is referenced as args although any other legal identifier name can be used since java 5  the main method can also use variable arguments  in the form of public static void main  string args   allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of string arguments the effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical  the args parameter is still an array of string objects   but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array the java launcher launches java by loading a given class  specified on the command line or as an attribute in a jar  and starting its public static void main  string    method stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly the string   args parameter is an array of string objects containing any arguments passed to the class the parameters to main are often passed by means of a command line printing is part of a java standard library  the system class defines a public static field called out the out object is an instance of the printstream class and provides many methods for printing data to standard out  including println  string  which also appends a new line to the passed string the string " hello world ! " is automatically converted to a string object by the compiler a more comprehensive example  edit  this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed  may 2013  this article contains instructions  advice  or how-to content the purpose of wikipedia is to present facts  not to train please help improve this article either by rewriting the how-to content or by moving it to wikiversity  wikibooks or wikivoyage  may 2013  // oddeven.java import javax.swing.joptionpane ;

import java.awt.graphics ; public class hello extends japplet  public void paintcomponent  final graphics g   g.drawstring  " hello  world ! "  65  95  ;   the import statements direct the java compiler to include the javax.swing.japplet and java.awt.graphics classes in the compilation the import statement allows these classes to be referenced in the source code using the simple class name  i.e japplet  instead of the fully qualified class name  fqcn  i.e javax.swing.japplet   the hello class extends  subclasses  the japplet  java applet  class ; the japplet class provides the framework for the host application to display and control the lifecycle of the applet the japplet class is a jcomponent  java graphical component  which provides the applet with the capability to display a graphical user interface  gui  and respond to user events the hello class overrides the paintcomponent  graphics  method  additionally indicated with the annotation  supported as of jdk 1.5  override  inherited from the container superclass to provide the code to display the applet the paintcomponent   method is passed a graphics object that contains the graphic context used to display the applet the paintcomponent   method calls the graphic context drawstring  string  int  int  method to display the " hello  world !

"  ;  finally  pw.close   ;    the import statements direct the java compiler to include all the public classes and interfaces from the java.io and javax.servlet packages in the compilation packages make java well suited for large scale applications the hello class extends the genericservlet class ; the genericservlet class provides the interface for the server to forward requests to the servlet and control the servlet 's lifecycle the hello class overrides the service  servletrequest  servletresponse  method defined by the servlet interface to provide the code for the service request handler the service   method is passed  a servletrequest object that contains the request from the client and a servletresponse object used to create the response returned to the client the service   method declares that it throws the exceptions servletexception and ioexception if a problem prevents it from responding to the request the setcontenttype  string  method in the response object is called to set the mime content type of the returned data to " text/html "  the getwriter   method in the response returns a printwriter object that is used to write the data that is sent to the client the println  string  method is called to write the " hello  world ! " string to the response and then the close   method is called to close the print writer  which causes the data that has been written to the stream to be returned to the client javaserver pages  edit  main article  javaserver pages javaserver pages  jsp  are server-side java ee components that generate responses  typically html pages  to http requests from clients jsps embed java code in an html page by using the special delimiters < % and % >  a jsp is compiled to a java servlet  a java application in its own right  the first time it is accessed after that  the generated servlet creates the response swing application  edit  main article  swing  java  swing is a graphical user interface library for the java se platform it is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of swing clones of windows  gtk + and motif are supplied by sun apple also provides an aqua look and feel for mac os x where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking  swing in java se 6 addresses this problem by using more native gui widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms this example swing application creates a single window with " hello  world ! " inside  // hello.java  java se 5  import javax.swing * ; public class hello extends jframe  public hello    super  " hello "  ; super.setdefaultcloseoperation  windowconstants.exit_on_close  ; super.add  new jlabel  " hello  world ! "   ; super.pack   ; super.setvisible  true  ;  public static void main  final string   args   new hello   ;   the first import includes all the public classes and interfaces from the javax.swing package the hello class extends the jframe class ; the jframe class implements a window with a title bar and a close control the hello   constructor initializes the frame by first calling the superclass constructor  passing the parameter " hello "  which is used as the window 's title it then calls the setdefaultcloseoperation  int  method inherited from jframe to set the default operation when the close control on the title bar is selected to windowconstants.exit_on_close — this causes the jframe to be disposed of when the frame is closed  as opposed to merely hidden   which allows the java virtual machine to exit and the program to terminate next  a jlabel is created for the string " hello  world ! " and the add  component  method inherited from the container superclass is called to add the label to the frame the pack   method inherited from the window superclass is called to size the window and lay out its contents the main   method is called by the java virtual machine when the program starts it instantiates a new hello frame and causes it to be displayed by calling the setvisible  boolean  method inherited from the component superclass with the boolean parameter true once the frame is displayed  exiting the main method does not cause the program to terminate because the awt event dispatching thread remains active until all of the swing top-level windows have been disposed generics  edit  main article  generics in java in 2004  generics were added to the java language  as part of j2se 5.0 prior to the introduction of generics  each variable declaration had to be of a specific type for container classes  for example  this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface  usually object  or a different container class has to be created for each contained class generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes  each containing almost identical code in addition to enabling more efficient code  certain runtime exceptions are converted to compile-time errors  a characteristic known as type safety criticism  edit  main article  criticism of java criticisms directed at java include the implementation of generics   46  speed   47  the handling of unsigned numbers   48  the implementation of floating-point arithmetic   49  and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary java vm implementation hotspot  50  use on unofficial software platforms  edit  the java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed a well-known unofficial java-like software platform is the android software platform  which allows the use of java 6 and some java 7 features  uses a different standard library  apache harmony reimplementation   different bytecode language and different virtual machine  and is designed for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers the android operating system makes extensive use of java-related technology google  edit  see also  oracle v google google and android  inc have chosen to use java as a key pillar in the creation of the android operating system  an open source mobile operating system although the android operating system  built on the linux kernel  was written largely in c  the android sdk uses the java language as the basis for android applications however  android does not use the java virtual machine  instead using java bytecode as an intermediate step and ultimately targeting android 's own dalvik virtual machine android also does not provide the full java se standard library  although the android class library does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it this led to a legal dispute between oracle and google on may 7  2012  a san francisco jury found that if apis could be copyrighted  then google had infringed oracle 's copyrights by the use of java in android devices  51  district judge william haskell alsup ruled on may 31  2012  that apis can not be copyrighted   52  but this was reversed by the ninth circuit court of appeals in may 2014  53   54  class libraries  edit  this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed  december 2014  main article  java class library the java class library is the standard library  developed to support application development in java it is controlled by sun microsystems in cooperation with others through the java community process program companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the apis this process has been a subject of controversy  when ?
