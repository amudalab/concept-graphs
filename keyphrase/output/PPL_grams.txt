high level view
program in machine
language a program
necessarily an algorithm
non terminating program
longer a algorithm
thing to realize
object it doesn
concrete um form
entity which requires
requires a concrete
computation which means
constitutes a primitive
possibly an infinite
sequence of steps
number of programs
notation for writing
emphasis the fact
notation is important
objects are finitary
represent any infinitary
manner you require
understandable you require
require certain rules
giving a finitary
kinds of infinitary
case an algorithm
necessarily be finitary

based languages means
trimaxes though unlike
talking of continuous
talking of discrete
case of functional
languages the notion
variable in mathematics
mathematics which means
history of languages
hundreds and hundreds
hundreds of programming
impossible to study
fifties and sixties

lisp is lisp
study the basic
features of languages
thing like language
design a language
language what kinds
kinds of issues
pascal has taught
set of unified
unified unified primitives
primitives for expressing
thing about pascal
sixty like languages
algorithms are written
dialect of pascal
pascal or algol
language easily learnable
people are taught
absolutely clear syntax
highly readable programs
readability that means
means by readability
readability it means
read the source
piece of software
fixed what hsppens
pieces of software
software have bugs
years and years
years after means
bug is detected
understand the algorithms
source code contained
write the person
person or persons
written this software
maintain the software
software in general
years the software
extend the software
adding new features
features by adding
reason so part
detection and correction
correction of bugs
software as years
team that wrote
wrote the software
language should provide
support for abstraction
abstraction the basic
basic abstraction mechanisms

things like procedures
functions in pascal
loops loop statements
kinds of control
kind of data
abstraction that pascal
abstraction that means
sequence of elements
single logical unit
unit um records
records variant records
abstraction data abstraction

derive the meaning
elements are formed
derivable in terms
connectives which formed
formed a complex
set of allowable
set theory notation
right the set
give a finitary
structure in terms
syntax the finitary
expressed in terms

interest in grammars
ultimately in generating
supposing that language
linear grammar left
grammar left linear
kind of production
set t star
symbol ok obtained
star as consisting
strings of length
union of cartesian
define a binary
operation called catenation
effect of catenation
strings and put
set t consists
bab the operation
operation of catenation
produce the string
catenation just juxtapose
operation on strings
string this string
set t cube
set t raised
sets are subsets
cross t star
length and juxtapose
string and juxtapose
juxtapose an empty
empty string satisfies
satisfies these conditions
star s concatenated
empty string equals
empty string concatenated
catenation is juxtaposition
fact the identity
element for catenation
right secondly catenation
catenation is associative
set the set
star under catenation
operation is associative
associative so catenation
arbitrary context sensitive
replace this non
small b appearing
sense this production
production is context
string and turns
minimal a minimal
context which means
don t care
care what appears
context really specifies
specifies the smallest
candidate for replacing
rule ok context
context sensitive grammars
enable a rule
rule to applied
grammar the minimal
padding the minimal
string which means
means you don
apply the production
sensitivity into account

succinct and clear
deal of information
category um expressions
expressions just denote
concept of store
concept of environment
illustrates the concept
transitions what transition
transition system rules
kinds of information
purely tree manipulation
tree manipulation process
step this transition
claim by rule
expression by rule
execut an execution
faulty um pardon
star five minus
step is missing
pardon no forget
parenthesis the parenthesis
pure lexical matter
matter it doesn
matter the parenthesis
tree is supposed
rules donot give
donot give complete
give complete evaluation
evaluation they give
step evaluation assuming
rules the rule
hand side operand
move a right
operand only provided
provided the left
perform that kind
kind of reason
add this rule
subtree to perform
perform a transition
right but supposing
add this extra
determinacy not ambiguity
complicated syntax tree
longer have deterministic
non deterministic behavior
kind of non
supposing you extend
language to include
preserve any semantics
semantics the results
order the runtime
runtime system chose
chose to evaluate
evaluate the expressions
expressions ok atleast
expand the language
language and add
loose any thing
makes it convenient
pragmatic and decent
give an implementer
implementer arbitrary choices
conflict in interpretation
add more rules
matter at hand
defining this semantics
fashion and determinism
pragmatic view point
user in case
case the language
language allows side
pascal many pascal
tumble pascal environment
choice of menus
floating point arithmetic
distribute over addition
addition or subtraction
amount of mathematical
actual floating point
floating point computation
lift these constraints
level of language
making it deterministic
helps the user
implementer to decide
adding extra rules
variety of interpretations
played absolutely safe
reduced the leftmost
allowed to proceed
add a rule
evaluations or independent
evaluations of right
right sub trees
things but adding
adding such rules
give more power
lead to flaws
flaws in implementation
underlying computational assumption
number of processes
language can affect
affect the complete
trivial and simple
long term consequences
clear and cut
clear and concise
craft the semantics
lot of trouble
trouble just crafting
designing this expression
language as part
parham with sixty
sixty four processors
rid off side
effects in function
explicitly ban side
ban side effects
interest of program
environment it makes
makes a lot
lot of sense
sense to introduce
introduce this extra
mixed with right
right to left
uni uniprocessor machine
machine in case
case you wanted
wanted to port
port the language
long term views
determinism actually create
create problems create
create more problems
solve more problems
things that sense
basic underlying computational
point the difference
determinism and non
determinism the difference
things the difference
right so writing
continue with declarations
declarations and commands
today s lecture
lecture on binding
discussed transition system
system for simple
simple expression language
compiling or parsing
expressions as trees
mind we give
assumed transition system
set of abstract
trees of integer
set of numerals
language the set
symbol to denote
defined the transition
number of binary
two rules applied
allowing only left
evaluate the right
evaluated the left
applied several times
yield a left
operand is evaluated
non deterministic set
non deterministic sequence
transitions evaluation possibilities
first three rules
expressions and depending
depending upon test
pepper your semantics
require for parenthesis
dealing with syntax
defines a compiler
right so today
start on declarations
give a general
means in programming
languages the field
field of programming
languages is cluttered
lot of terminologies
issues to study
require a unified
terminology to discuss
discuss all programming
notion of binding
purely pragmatic issue
notions of binding
prevalent early binding
early binding compile
compile time binding
run time binding
etcetera the earliest
mathematics without mathematicians
mathematicians consciously aware
names and declarations
discuss the semantics
semantics of declarations
declarations we discuss
discuss the notion
notion of bindings
discuss the pragmatic
concentrate on names
don t matter
moment what matters
summation in mathematics
denote some complex
phrase to denote
issues that arises
sigma i equals
denotes an applied
defined a binding
purely applied occurrence
expression was lifted
out of context
defined mathematical context
context so binding
occurrences could occurred
deep into inside
inside um inside
inside some mathematical
names and naming
binding occurrences proceed
proceed the applied
occurrences actually occur
binding occurrences appears
first binding occurrence
similarly starts form
dark blue region
binding occurrences occurs
binding occurrence occurs
binding occurrence precedes
precedes the applied
refers to summation
necessarily always valid
valid a binding
occurrence usually means
means a declaration
declaration in programming
programming it means
occurrences and applied
applied occurrences occur
statement in terms
quantifier the scope
problems in mathematics
case the moment
moment you state
easy the fact
occurrence later assuming
assuming that meaning
typical pascal kind
cases in programming
programming binding occurrences
binding occurrences occur
occur as parts
parts of declarations
introduce new variables
case of mathematics
mathematics the binding
introduced new names
reasons many programming
efficiency of compilation
reasons many languages
languages actually insists
insists that binding
occurrences should precede
precede applied occurrences
constant um ten
literal pi equals
equals three point
equals pi star
star m star
names are applied
variable is first
applied occurrences including
typical binding occurrences
equal some expression
expression e end
typical ml session
beginning as val
val y equals
equals something val
creating an environment
environment of names
defines by introduction
introduction or redefines
redefines an existing
names are identifiers
occurrence just refers
refers or denotes
denotes the meaning
pascal as defining
defining some binding
completely get rid
rid of names
pascal which insists
precedues the arrows
program of pascal
pascal all variables
eventually be bound
bound all identifiers
typical pascal program
fortan program includes
environment through libraries
initial um global
global environment provided
kinds of bindings
meanings of bindings
two simple instances
language a pascal
pascal like language
declarations al right
language a functional
language has declarations
language this constant
fact the functional
functional language declaration
variable being updated
variable location binding
location binding remains
binding remains unchanged
location value binding
changed by commands
language in general
include the notion
memory as part
updates and assignments
assignments are prohibited
language a variable
cases the function
function um function
binding whereas variables
variables in imperative
languages implicitly assume
assume the existence
notion of memory
memory or store
location what content
updating that location
language this complication
complication of locations
locations um memories
variable constant variable
variable it represents
variable is declared
declared it represents
unlike a imperative
binding the location
binding is effective
effective as apposed
variable is stored
denotes a denotes
address in memory
memory pragmatically speaking
thing that remains
location value bindings
bindings which means
case of memory
locations it means
means the contents
issue of bindings
point this out
interested in bindings
view of declarations
give the semantics
pascal like program
begin end block
normal lexical scope
lexical scope rules
variable i declared
declared here extends
extends across extends
procedure the scope
constant i extends
entire fragment provided
statically scope languages
extent of program
binding occurrence applies
language for learning
block structured languages
languages allow nested
find this find
find the declaration
actual binding appears
allowed nested scoping
allowed the creation
creation of holes
spoiling the readability
occurrence it makes
occurrence and verify
verify various things
puts an extra
ban all nested
give a programmer
disallow nested bindings
names before deciding
task which means
thing the entire
entire programming team
team should declare
declare should decide
large software project
spoils a lot
lot of things
disastrous in languages
languages with default
intended to put
intended to introduce
forgot to declare
forgot to introduce
introduce this declaration
deeply nested inside
nested bindings complicate
bindings complicate matters
terms of debugging
debugging and readability
clinches the issue
clinch the issue
case of ada
give the programmer
programmer the flexibility
flexibility to decide
complicate some matters
languages like fortan
identifier that starts
real variable right
makes makes matter
matter really bad
choose your identifier
reflect the pro
pro the problem
compiler also compiled
system is executing
solving a problem
disasters um space
satellites was due
written in fortan
supposedly do statement
entire do statement
ten i equals
execute that loop
loop fifteen times
disaster was due
fortan program bug
small typographical error
typographical error spelling
error spelling errors
bound by default
languages like algol
kinds of implicit
type the actual
stretched out part
normal scope scope
scope scope rules
speaking even binding
single binding occurrence
case of variables
value binding occurs
occurs several times
relative location binding
location binding occurs
occurs at compile
location to absolute
absolute location binding
occurs at runtime
block structured language
dynamic memory allocation
call that procedure
base address relative
spectrum from compile
kinds of binding
denoting a single
overloading of addition
addition and multiplication
multiplication and subtraction
two different meanings
two different identifiers
identifiers integer addition
addition and real
addition or floating
floating point addition
point addition integer
addition integer multiplication
multiplication and floating
floating point multiplication
scope these identifiers
two different bindings
stores the result
result of executing
executing the function
scope also denotes
function is returned
overloading this overloading
languages like ada
representing different kind
kind different objects
types of parameters
infix plus operations
concatenation of strings
denote integer addition
addition or real
terms of language
types of operands
operands or order
order of operands
implementation view point
constant variable bindings
static type checking
checking or atleast
facility of static
bindings as early
run time languages
value and identifier
identifier location bindings
done at run
typically with dynamic
dynamic data structures
location bindings occurring
occurring at runtime
farther so languages
languages like snowball
snowball and lisp
run time bindings
bindings as apposed
apposed to compile
compile time bindings
spectrum of doing
loosely speaking order
speaking order languages
cobol um fortan
early early bindings
bindings in fact
done at compile
complete memory allocation
allocation is done
code the bindings
bindings are completed
bindings of variables
memory address absolute
address absolute address
absolute address binding
binding are done
done at loading
compile fortan program
code that means
linking and loading
loading the entire
entire address calculation
calculation is completed
result and fortan
static memory allocation
kind of memory
running the program
language every code
done at runtime
completely statically partition
statically partition memory
addresses are calculated
delayed till loading
result fortan programs
overhead of memory
allocation and changing
dynamically created data
created data structures
cost of flexibility
bal and lisp
fresh memory allocation
bindings at runtime
runtime which means
require a garbage
collector which tells
result these languages
general very slow
absolutely no static
pascal modula ada
relative address binding
binding at compile
postpone the relative
relative address absolute
binding to runtime
fortan mostly static
compiler detects recursion
recursion it detects
graph construction process

talk about environments
hidden the last
lecture we discussed
discussed the notion
talking about identify
identify value bindings
case of constants
constants identify location
identify location bindings
updations normally assignments
talking about location
pragmatically speaking bindings
decide to stretch
out a binding
identify location binding
identifier relative location
temporarily decentralized manner
early bindings late
bindings late bindings
core of bindings
lets say type
checking in pascal
absolutely no guarantee
variable um typing
resolves so binding
design a compiler
design interpret shoots
shoots a convenient
make a compile
compile time checking
checking um set
set of easy
checking at compile
run into execution
execution s faster
case with languages
languages like snobol
produce an extreme
extreme of flexibility
delay all windings
creation of environment
processing of declarations
affect the rest
language so lets
defined an expression
explicitly for bidden
expression language consisting
expression containing identifiers
obtain a meaning
identifier in terms
identifier value binding
value the meaning
case mostly represents
represents the ultimate
slightly more holistic
fashion so lets
set of expressions
expressions capital script
integer valued expression
denote non terminal
denote the syntax
trees that means
maintain this distinction
define a transition
expressions the terminal
left right evaluation
evaluation or expressions
language with declarations
declarations very similar
worried about types
simplified the syntax
write let val
removed the keyword
declaration hidden inside
inside that expression
declaration itself expression
expression in terms
aim might occur
goal the value
identifier i ofcourse
simplify these things
replacing all occurrences
declarations such namings
writing one long
variables in function
functional programming language
kind of binding
variable in zml
collection of functions
functions of values
expression whose value
value is validated
program as consisting
number of declarations
finally an expression
holes and scheme
expression to give
give a find
find a value
notion of identifiers
mathematics or logic
define when identifiers
identifiers are free
free the notion
identifier gets bound
meaning of free
language the free
sentence that sentence
sentence is suppose
sentence a free
notion of freeness
freeness of identifiers
grammar for expressions
notion of free
numeral the set
set of free
set of names
names that occur
single turn set
tree the free
actual expression value
expression the free
define this identifier
set um set
difference or set
define the set
set of bound
bound identifiers undo
pattern the set
defined by induction
tree so numerals
numerals an simple
identifiers a simple
numerals and simple
individual components note
case the set
union the set
bound expression identifiers
processing a meaning
freeness and bound
bound identifiers exist
bindings or explicit
completely closed program
complete pascal program
run time system
pascal runtime system
pascal program supposing
supposing you don
libraries library routines
absolutely no free
identifier the program
routines every identifier
identifier is declared
entire pascal program
identifiers all identifiers
identifiers are bound
means every identifier
occurrence which defines
absolutely no identifiers
fact the transition
right so closed
closed in ground
two important terms
terms which occurred
identifiers the program
identifiers which required
identifiers a bound
complete program executes
require an environment
identifiers which require
expression transition system
identifiers they obtain
obtain their meaning
kinds of identifiers
interested in identifiers
mapping from capital
set of numerics
accurately a set
set of values
set of variable
variable value bindings
collection of variables
envv to denote
denote the set
environments over capital
right so lets
entity from expressions
idea to abstract
separate non terminal
fact by abstracting
out a separate
syntax and separate
separate reserved words
words to make
make it clear
expressions or commands
separate declaration language
basis and give
sequences of declarations

depending upon first
evaluating the declarations
required this rule
rule and remember
systems are simple
process of evaluation

give you environments
environment the meaning
rules for ordinary

process of evaluating
evaluating you create
create a temporary
change in environment
environment in order
order to enable

redundant things lots
lots of redundant
rules such configurations
purely syntactically entity
effect of sequencing
sequencing on declarations
right so supposing
introduce an environment
first have provided
constraint by left
non deterministic transitions
add extra rules
right but note
general the sequential
sequence of constant
declaration could depend
first constant declaration
give a complex
shouldn t evaluate
introduce this environment
row d yield
result of elaborating
preclude certain possibilities
pascal constant declaration
defined this declaration
process this declaration
nested lets construct

mechanisms to static
static binding mechanisms
wait for run
introduction of declarations
amount of complication
complication so lets
lets just assume
rid of commands
commands and lets
purely functional fragment
typical typed declaration
declaration of lets
normal declaration mechanisms
pipelining of declarations
declarations the parallel
evaluation of declaration
independence of declarations
declarations and nesting
sort of complication
complication it raises
variables the moment
moment you introduce
declarations that means
concept of free
variables and bound
type therefore creating
type checking process
structurally inductive definitions
free and defined
elementary value expression
run time semantics
case of sequencing
declarations the declared
variables and free
exclude those variables
condition of disjointness
individual defined variables
case of nested
complex you abstract
sub expressions give
meant to define
free variables remains
variables remains unchanged
two d minus
minus declared variable
essentially we require
free and declared
contexts a context
program inductively speaking
free variables lets
require in order
notion of context
values during run
context in order
order to determine
done is supposed
semantics which deals
delayed a lot
lot in coming
syntax pragmatics static
pragmatics static semantics
semantics and dynamic
represents the dynamic
define for type
checking is static
complete language document
document a language
defines the syntax
syntax the static
start on procedures
procedures programming languages
start on abstraction
context of contexts
contexts and type
inferencing and type
language the implicit
run time case
case we assume
variable to value
case of type
checking are implicit
forced to assume
assumptions in mind
gave this simple
reason for giving
giving such type
elementary and lets
dispose off expressions
inferencing is done
done how type
checking are related
lets quickly run
language namely variables
commands were concerned
commands are made
assume a predicate
type to assign
type check complex
check complex commands
commands in terms
extra type checking
type checking rule
rule we require
make the problem
problem too complex
imperative command structure
collections of variables
case how type
extend this language
include a language
essentially the type
checking or type
commands and expressions
expressions would produce
produce would proceed
worry about commands
simple functional language
hav a declaration
val x equals
give the type
type checking system
assume the declarations
pascal like declaration
added an extra
easy to derive
options on pattern
holds in case
case you extend
commands for commands
commands with declarations
pascal like declarations
easily taken care
declarations the moment
bring in declarations
bringing in bound
variables or free
variables the notion
variables becomes important
definition of free
similar structurally defined
structurally defined sets
sets of defined
variables its important
out of scope
assume you give
colour the free
free variable set
defined variable set
natural static scoping
derives its type
derives its value
constitutes the free
declaration similar things
two that disjointness
condition is made
declarations the nested
declaration really refers
require additional names
names to abstract
expresions and give
usual the variables
union actually constitutes
variables and declare
declare a defined
variables in declarations
declarations in order
enable a definition
include some variables
union the declaration
declaration d involves
variables previously declared
variables that occur
program you don
assume an assignment
assignment of types
collections of identifiers
calculus a context
variable to types
types is meant
meant to denote
identifiers which denotes
right a higher
set of types
grammar yeah infact
types will denote
types i don
polymorphic types type
types type variables
dealing with polymorphism
doing a backward
integration into lower
levels so lets
environments we require
interchangeably with context
context and type
environment so temporary
gamma and delta
sets of variables
variables this updation
updation of gamma
gamma by delta
variable of delta
extended the notion
notion of defined
variables from syntax
variables of delta
context and gamma
updated with delta
defined its defined
delta are defined
defined the type
occurs in delta
variable in delta
declarations for type
presence of environments
run time environments
environments this creates
type binding type
applicable which means
kind of default
type some type
context is created
essentially the translation
translation takes place
essentially the run
environment the execution
stops there aborts
similarly the translation
produce little type
bindings in gamma
create a collection
collection of bindings
environment which creates
environment where delta
created by processing
updated type environment
original context gamma
gamma this declarations
two actually creates
delta one updated
updated by delta
delta two note
variable might occur
allowed in languages
environment the value
contexts are created
two declaration mechanisms
disjoint ness condition
two are type
type environment delta
composite declaration produces
delta one union
ness condition ensures
ensures that delta
create the environment
two the type
type environment defined
two as free
gamma and lets
assume that creates
type environment gamma
environment gamma delta
delta one process
two to obtain
environment type environment
two yeah right
declarations create contexts
checking with contexts
contexts so right
collection of assume
gamma which means
means the collection
variable to identifier
identifier to type
require an explicit
case any constants
types are obtained
obtained by pattern
variable its type
trivial type checking
tou one tou
forward these tables
tables for type
inferencing actually means
question of command
type which means
means both arms
type the result
evaluating e nought
tou which means
returns in execution
type tou provided
compile time determinable
evaluation of booleans
expression is determined
declaration which creates
type little type
evaluate the type
updated context determine
determine the type
defined variables identifiers
gamma the type
building up contexts
scopes your context
environment keeps shrinking
specifies only types
structure of typing
important an important
badly typed run
run time executions
out a program
bothering to execute
noticed that typing
programmers may type
checking the type
difference between type
closely very related
interactive session means
system can deduce
principal type forget
deduce the type
identifier to introduce
introduce the declaration
introducing new identifiers
type system accepts
form of deduction
form of equation
solving using unification
explicit type specifications
specifications for identifiers
identifiers and expressions
expressions are inferred
pattern matching means
language it means
explicitly they don
infers the type
checking the expressions
explicit base type
base type definitions
define this function
lets say head
incomplete pattern matching
define this pattern
pattern h cons
reserved word fun
unary function lets
put this brackets
applies on lists
kind i don
satisfies this pattern
return h right
assigns a type
list where alpha
alpha where alpha
type int list
equalize this alpha
list with int
pattern matching facility
facility and infers
infers that alpha
context it assigns
alpha the value
value of int
trivial equation solving
value of alpha
alpha list equals
list equals int
equals int list
alpha is int
apply this head
true comma false
complicated type checking
type checking type
checking type inferencing
type inferencing equation
inferencing equation solving
words like list
list as function
unification algorithm arrow
int bool real
things are function
alpha arrow alpha
arrow alpha list
list of functions
constructors the tuple
tuple type constructor
string i shouldn
shouldn t call
postfix function constructor
types this arrow
types the star
unification algorithm runs
runs the unification
equation solving right
done the equation
inferred the values
session here alpha
assigns it assigns
assigns a principal
type that means
means it assigns
assigns it finds
set of equations
head over undefined
kinds of list
head over list
functions of type
type alpha arrow
base type definition
types it remains
generates new type
variables are expressed
simply typed language
alpha should solve
type checking assuming
set of type
variables and base
give this declarations
two t sorted
declaration is required
equal to relation
defined on strings
specifies and determines
determines the type
list of int
empty int list
equal to type
checks for integers
integers it doesn
doesn t type
boolean so sorted
list to bool
programmers are lazy
explicitly specifying types
explicitly specify type
make type mistakes
convenience with typing
checking they expect
explicit type specifier
inferencing the type
inferencing is restricted
restricted to expressions
require a sophisticated
sophisticated type constructor
type constructor collection
written no inferencing
types every expression
amount of type
essentially to maintain
consistency of types
set of inference
system can determine
message unresolved type
type or ambiguous
ambiguous type unable
unable to resolve
strong actually pascal
strongly typed pascal
functions as parameters
parameters the types
typed most types
types are determinable
notion of compilation
weak dynamic typing
dynamic typing dynamic
typing dynamic type
type checking facility
operation is applied
check the consistency
lisp and scheme
underlined base types
thirty six today
today so today
principle of abstraction
book he defines
defines the principle
semantically meaningful syntactic
meaningful syntactic category
done some abstraction
point about abstraction
lets not confuse
confuse this word
whn we talk
talk about abstraction
group of objects
necessarily mean code
data or code
code any object
form of abstraction
group of people
people equipment furniture
equipment furniture rooms
languages also form
form some part
grouping of objects
don t necessarily
sense of programming
field of activity
out by giving
expression is intended
expression you split
purely logical reasons
programmer he removes
removes that sub
expression may puts
puts a declaration
programmer has done
performed an abstraction
construct is concerned
equals i don
expression three star
helpful atleast convenient
atleast convenient atleast
atleast to abstract
expression the main
form of hiding
takes some complicated
object or group
perceived as irrelevant
irrelevant or unnecessary
pieces of equipment
black box view
details are hidden
hidden the internal
mechanisms are hidden
open the black
inside the scope
looked at abstractions
blocks or lambda
abstractions and naming
give his famous
right so naming
forms of abstractions
view of programming
syntactic categories expression
categories expression expressions
expression expressions commands
procedures in imperative
looked at expression
procedures procedural abstracts
notion of procedural
book on scheme
similar and related
abstraction in imperative
declarartions also declarations
declarations or definitions
modules or classes
classes okay modules
collection of declarations
right a class
parametrized to include
include various subtyping
subtyping and inheritance
detail but lets
firstly its naming
incongruous or plain
properties or objects
form a naming
forms of local
forms a logical
form of local
form a local
names for abstracts
case of programming
languages same computations
right the thing
thing with unnamed
atleast two occurences
abbreviated an abbreviated
kind of computations
moment semantically speaking
speaking the moment
introduce a binding
generate some code
semantical use risght
pragmatically names create
names create fresh
create fresh bindings
provide this convenience
user of repeated
referenced by single
parametrize the names
duplicate many similar
computations by varying
varying the parameters
collection of parameters
perform this abstraction
call the interface
inside the black
performing another form
emphasizing the similarities
computations and deemphasizing
deemphasizing or hiding
hiding the differences
right so abstraction
emphasize or highlight
highlight the similarity
emphasize the dissimilarities
issue of naming
naming has cropped
question of mobile
computations with cellular
cellular phones cord
phones cord phones
phones the specification
out that naming
years of programming
languages yeah right
abstracts that means
means the expressions
abstracts which means
means those commands
means those declarations
naming the issue
issue of parameters
done unnamed blocks
blocks and abstractions
bodies are executed
executed or elaborated
elaborated or evaluated
naming and parametrizing
question of parametrizing
parametrizing again balls
matter of performing
environment the issue
question of performing
performing a substitution
eventually all forms
forms of computation
forms of substitution
environments appropriate substitutions
concentrate on naming
naming and control
abstraction most programming
languages most imperative
form of procedures
encapsulation of commands
group of commands
essentially gift wrapping
languages your parametrization
parametrization is optional
right in languages
sixty even naming
blocks in algol
define a unnamed
encapsulation of comands
captures the essential
corresponds to functions
greatly abused word
term expression procedures
commands their bodies
bodies are commands
values of expressions
state or change
procedures in pascal
entities in pascal
reserved word function
function are expression
expression procedures entities
reserved word procedure
procedure are command
procedures in general
denote any form
form of command
type of object
classify the kind
kind of beast
naming so lets
pascal like syntax
pascal like procedure
typical procedure structure
structure is reserved
named a procedure
procedure identifier parameters
semicolon some local
local declarations begin
begin a command
object which represents
represents this command
abstraction the syntax
syntax for performing
performing the command
abstraction procedure parameters
procedure parameters local
parameters local declarations
begin c end
similarly for functions
expression procedure defined
defined by function
function parameters colon
colon some type
type semicolon local
semicolon local declarations
local declarations command
side effects global
effects global variables
returned as function
function values supposing
collection of values
return a pointer
pointer to structures
type to treat
global and perform
perform the side
effects and make
return a boolean
actual side effects
interested the actual
stored through side
effects on globals
assigned some expression
created as part
rigid pascal syntax
type is involved
abstract the abstract
abstract the expression
addressed many implementations
pascal actually refers
refuses to recognize
recognize a recursive
recursive parameterless function
function it assumes
simple syntactic ways
ways of changing
rectifying this ambiguity
variable just call
making a recursive
recursive call make
patches of doing
doing of changing
point the point
commands changing state
finally finally returning
returning a value
previous example lets
essentially the intutive
procedure and give
store the evaluation
procedure or pascal
pascal like function
store and returns
returns a value
takes appropriate parameters
setting it means
procedures it means
final store sigma
place it inline
postpone the semantics
talking about naming
naming and identifiers
issue of scope
non local identifier
non local references
references are determined
statically that means
detremined at compile
thought of execution
occurences are determined
innermost enclosing scope
enclosing scope rule
identifier also includes
includes procedure identifiers
procedure identifiers function
identifiers function identifiers
innermost lexically enclosing
lexically enclosing scope
compile time determined
scoping or lexical
naturally called static
languages including including
including including scheme
including scheme important
scheme important including
important including scheme
supposed to static
dynamic scoping rules
non local reference
non local identifiers
things the binding
program the binding
run time stack
innermost enclosing call
enclosing call rule
innermost enclosing block
enclosing block rule
piece of text
text a call
run time object
nesting of calls
pictorially so lets
worry about boundaries
write x colon

dot it means
call the static
out no machine
read the printout
sort of block
boundaries i wont
wont say scope
scope boundaries lets
entire boundary purple

execution time behaviour
behaviour so lets
behaviour lets assume
call to procedure
executing the body
find this reference
enclosing calling environment
innermost call rule
calling chain assuming
similar calling chain
occurences can change
make any commitments
read the declarations
processing the body
sequence of calls
performed at run
chase the sequence
dynamic scoping environment
environment at compile
made about non
made that means
act of compiling
create any bindings
program which means
dispensive the compiler
interpret the program
systems are interpreters
features these days
purely interpretive programming
interpretive programming systems
pragmatic than planned
initial environment consisting
consisting of globals
chain the innermost
call rule tells
scoping under dynamic
scoping rules refers
static nesting structure
static nesting chain
hit this green
hit this purple
textually very nice
compile time cogeneration
maintain the static
capture the static
program the textual
structure the lexical
lexical scoping structure
hand the dynamic
require this extra
overhead of maintaining
maintaining that information
stack and find
rules are implemented
purpose of reading
reading a program
program or debugging
maintain this information

continue next programming
continue with procedural
purpose of abstraction
shakspeare asked whats
kinds of abstracts
partly procedural abstracts
commands command abstracts
definition or declaration
simula small talk
small talk etcetera
important semantic issue
parameters to capture
similarity of computations
type checkable body
concentrating on control
expression abstracts denotes
abstracts denotes functions
form of control
basically like functions
pascal or procedures
procedures which change
kinds of scope
languages like scheme
pascal c ada
ada algol sixty
static scoping mechanism
easier to debug
case of dynamic
chain of calls
assuming this large
level of nesting
nesting and independent
language this non

dynamically scoped language
language this reference
recent calling block
block most recent
invocation of block
difference between static
dynamically scoped languages
environment so lets
run time run
talking of compile
stack the activation
sort of normal
program usually works
require some global
standard io procedures
two are local
program p means
create a jump
address the address
type check parameters
information on kinds
kinds of parameters
basically their types
compiling this main

require these return
calling sequence looked
looked at backwards
remember the calling
chain which points
essentially you require
require this dynamic
maintained at execution
easier to implement
implement a dynamic
dynamic scoping mechanism
present lets assume
hat it means
phrase you translate
chain to find
out some reference
reference where find
out the first
occurs since translation
translation and execution
information about identifiers

textually read translated
read translated code
code is created
created and executed

significantly changed implementations
case of recursion
thing about naming
provide a form
abstraction and important
kind of naming
explicit goto statement
block with naming
automatically make recursive
make recursive calls
point about implementations
organized your run
environment in languages
supposed to run
fortran in fortran
fortran every block
block was independent
allocated in memory
contained persistent data
absolute static address
fortran like environment
environment with static
pink block code
block code segment
code segment cum

cum data separate
forgotten the color
segment and data
two the question
question of nesting
arose so lets
two one don
don t exist
fixed for life
references whether local
local or non
fixed absolute address
calls because recursive
recursive calls means
kind of run
fast having fixed
fortran programs execute
complications of allocating
fresh at run
run time deallocating
deallocating traversings pointers
fast one reason
reason why scientific
written in fortran
people are feeling
feeling too lazy
lazy to change
recursion the moment
form of stack
memory of activation
open up make
make it flexible
purpose of implementing
essentially one activation
chain pointer pointing
return pointer pointing
assuming the case
duplicate these static

exit one invocation
pointer the address
absolutely no problem

write a logical
predicate with quantifiers
separates the variables
inside a quantifier
quantifier this colon
environment is type
environment gamma provided
provided every variable
right every variable
row v applied
type that gamma
ensures that things
things also run
run time check
colon this colon
two this dark
dark blue colons
variables or values
values this colon
extension from single
values to collections
variables and values
two dark blue
light blue colon
symbolism for writing
definitions so function
removed this capital
identifiers say lets
lets say capital
checks whether type
environment so functions
identifiers have values
values actual values
bound with variables
assume for simplicity
declaration in isolation
single lambda abstraction
carried lambda abstractions
things are isomorphic
present for simplicity
essentially non local
kinds of bound
isolation that means
part of lets
session and put
put it lets
extract the values
extract their values
right and create
fresh let declarations
session a simple
first defined lets
lets say val
integer and lets
function this function
function the meaning
abstraction the lambda
completely closed lambda
closed lambda expression
closure the reason
abstractions as closures
function or procedure
defined the abstraction
library of programs
resolve those non
function i extract
infact the purpose
out in isolation
lot of environmental
give an abstraction
abstraction a meaning
meaning in isolation
include the information
closure of function
definition then stands
abstraction and whats
whats a function
language we don
directly have beta
form of lets
environment you evaluate
don t create
purely functional language
possibility of side
amount of environment
equals e nought
lambda abstraction assume
wouldn t require
require any environments
redeclarations of variables
abstraction a function
lambda abstraction applied
doing in call
redoing that function
rewrite that function
discussion on parameter
expression e nought
evaluate e nought
essentially you don
don t touch
touch the function
evaluated e nought
finally got reduced
higher order value
references which means
write this kind
equals let row
colon tou nought
tou nought equals
evaluating the argument
completely and function
call is applied
parameter transmission mechanisms
transmission mechanisms application
calculus in functional
two principle mechanisms
remember we considered
considered this infinite
leftmost outermost beta
outermost beta redex
expression again choose
choose the leftmost
inside to choose
choose the redex
levels of paranthesis
paranthesis to find
find the redex
redex from left
read from left
leftmost outermost reduction
deterministic okay remember
lambda calculus operation
calculus operation semantics
make it deterministic
deterministic by choosing
normal form beta
form beta normal
order of reduction
reduction is guaranteed
guaranteed to produce
case of leftmost
outermost beta reduction
evaluate an operand
doing a beta
reading the lambda
operands of beta
beta redexes inside
reduce those operands
inside the lambda
inside the operands
attempt to first
reduce the operands
apply the beta
form you wont
wont go deep
order to reduce
operands and reduce
produce normal forms
value can converge
converge faster right
infinite computations normal
computations normal forms
forms are guaranteed
operator l applied
produce copies lots
lots of copies
decide to reduce
form without doing
doing extra reduction
reduction on copies
thing to implement
implement a call
presence of replicating
languages use call
start parameter passing
mechanisms in imperative
imperative languages programming
languages programming languages
discuss parameter passing
issues are pragmatic
complicated to give
basic parameter passing
parameter passing mechanisms
purely pragmatic view
purely pragmatic point
lambda calculus setting
evaluate the operand
perform the application
right now thw
thw whole question
applied lambda calculi
calculi whether typed
case typed applied
typed applied lambda
languages are call
value and call
results but call
untyped case call
guaranteed to give
exists but call
easy implementation compared
implementation anyway coming
coming to procedural
languages or imperative
question of parameter
attitudinal problem problem
call the question
component or record
container a container
made this distinction
essentially that confusion
give an expression
simple arithmetic expression
parameter e denotes
regard this expresion
expresion as denoting
denoting a value
regard this expression
expression is open
two different interpretations
pass the location
passing that object
passing the value
value contained inside
inside that object
calling this procedure
passing the expression
parameter in large
parts of mathematics
confusion never arose
pass the expression
pas the value
results in mathematics
case the results
interested in passing
passing its value
passing its location
type lambda calculus
mathematics in mathematics
pasing a value
expression as regarded
matter a call
closely inter interwoven
produce different results
beta reduction rule
rule that means
scan a lambda
term the moment
moment you find
find a lambda
reduce the operand
apply the left
left the outermost
case the operand
doing is substituting
substituting the entire
operand in place
method of passing
justify a lot
semantics as call
implemented in pascal
imperative languages call
implemented was algol
derivatives of algol
stanford artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence language
intelligence language sail
kind of thing
call by refernce
pascal and fortran
ada question mark
clear what ada
remember the activation
records and stack
place for parameters
evaluate the actual
parameter to obtain
obtain a value
expression including lets
formal parameter lets
parameter lets lets
structure of procedures
parameters okay lets
lets lets call
procedure this procedure
difference between functions
extra local variable
variable to store
store the result
draw the formal
formal to actual
question of interpretation
interpretation now reduces
denote the value
assign the formal
parameter this value
performing a implicit
implicit assignment operation
parameter is initialized
execute the procedure
supposing the actual
variable an array
component or lets
value of values
broad pragmatic view
things like value
elementary mathematical functions
interested in producing
producing side effects
side effects due
reasons are lie
lie in pascal
function can return
scalar data type
data type value
type value supposing
thing like making
values global returning
returning one value
value and producing
producing a side
modify that actual
actual in general
general in general
kinds of variations
effects through modification
created by explicit
assignments of assignments
assignments to global
dealing with pointers
assignments to formal
reflected in actual
write various lisp
lisp lisp based
lisp based programs
programs in pascal
scheme functions elementary
functions elementary scheme
elementary scheme functions
functions and programmed
programmed in pascal
function call const
const which takes
process of first
modifying the pointer
effects the end
heap based data
based data structure
modifying the value
changed your global
modified global environment
pass the list
pointer okay lop
head by deallocating
deallocating the head
putting the pointers
list and infact
produce side effects
single parameter passing
parameter passing mechanism
normal variables call
produces no side
parameters through explicit
referencing and dereferencing
pass the value
dereference that pointer
produced side effects
changed its value
changed the contents
produced a side
primitives for referencing
value parameter mechanism
doesn t satisfy
satisfy this constraint
copying in phase
phase after executing
executing the procedure
copy out phase
copy back values
memory based system
denoting a location
back is done
created a side
procedure still remains
back the values
procedure all intermediate
kinds of parameter
typical aida procedure
parameters which means
copying out phase
plane out parameters
call by result
parameters they stand
procedure begins execution
out of values
generally accepted conjucture
languages from fortran
parameters in pascal
parameter is required
fortran a long
explicitly provided mechanism
things so supposing
two formal parameters
integer an intermediate
standard swap procedure
call this procedure
two actual parameters
implemented as value
out the values
value result mechanism
result mechanism supposing
supposing we extended
pascal parameter passing
made this change
assigned the values
parameters are assigned
single entry single
entry single exit
single exit black
exit black box
forming the interface
copying in position
procedure is executing
distinct complete functional
complete functional unit
hand of cousre
implement this swap
swap by reference
parameters or reference
assigned the value
means the address
assigned the address
integer actual parameter
fashion you dereference
value and put
act of dereferencing
dereferencing x means
variable a taking
taking its value
value and assigning
assign the value
dereferenced value contained
copy that value
copy the value
referencing dereferencing primitives
effects of call
captured by call
pascals peculiar constraints
functions can return
procedure or define
efffects of call
value but provided
absence of referencing
value can produce
produce no side
effects except explicit
assignments to globals
reference side effects
mechanism the effects
effects are delayed
exiting the procedure
capture all effects
reference all side
reference by call
result only provided
call are distinct
result and vice
procedure presumably takes
quotient and remainder
statement which modified
order to buffer
buffer the effects
quotient which means
value result implementation
supposing you assume
compilers and run
run time systems
order because parameters
order are important
equals one right
doing this kind
problem suppose inside
inside the procedure
actual parameter inside
out the difference
two in effects
books on programming
languages most books
books actually claim
captured the effects
give you unnecessary
pass really large
things quite complicated
array referencing array
referencing array index
array index computations
index computations array
computations array index
array index modifications
index modifications inside
complicated and reasoning
tricky it means
passing large structures
large structures huge
structures huge arrays
arrays a bitmap
pass large structures
usage of store
create an output
create the side
end of execution
bits by million
million bits passed
copy in phase
mechanism to produce
produce the required
required side effects
reasons why call
large large list
large list structures
structures or large
large array structures
structures or record
matter one address
require a single
text which comprises
comprises the actual
actual which comprises
model the behaviour
means before executing
procedure i replace
replace all occurences
essentially the effect
produce a macro
free variable captured
record this problem
language but looked
reduction being modeled
free variable capture
rename all local
alpha conversion mechanism
language that part
essentially the resulting
expression the resulting
environment that means
means the procedure
abbreviation for taking
taking the entire
procedure after replacing
block a procedure
abbreviation a parametrized
call all side
giving the large
deals with large
copying in copying
effects on large
captured immediately array
immediately array dereferencing
dereferencing or array
effect which call
guarantee that call
equivalent to call
value the parameter
parameter is evaluated
replacement that actual
actual parameters evaluate
formal is referenced
passes an actual
two successive references
general for imperative
mechanism it means
means repeatedly evaluating
formal is encountered
encountered you execute
execute the text
reevaluate that expression
mechanism can produce
produce different effects
textual the text
consists of non
language the parameters
innermost enclosing text
enclosing text innermost
innermost calling block
language can produce
pascal have procedures
procedures as parameters
sought so supposing
set of procedures
blue the main
blue the blue
procedure which calls
calls a function
function f passed
means this formal
function deeply nested
environment of non
local references inside
inside the function
body any reference
call this function
create the static
static environment suitable
send the static
chain pointer address
references in keeping
statically scoped structure
weak parameter passing
creates more confusion
programming higher order
functions like map
atleast first level
first level higher
level higher order
list based functions

reason why arrays
form of direct
array um array
firstly these arrays
pascal the bounds
type the type
give an accurate

essentially several models
models of computation
firstly it tells
difference between program
program and data
kinds of bit
matter of interpretation
out of data
interpret certain bit

write higher order
exploit the hardware
fast on hardware

ten times faster
write in software
good pragmatic reason
languages or applied
calculi they provide
provide this excellent
excellent structuring facility
