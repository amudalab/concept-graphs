readjust the pointer
pointer and bring
reach another vertex
done fill pixels

move that fokay
vertical edge update
finishes the loop
complete this cycle
short a sort
construct edge table

lot of calculation
implementing these algorithms
simple you initialize
process each polygon

update your depth
step is initialize
initialize with set

sso that makes
obtain intersection points
points of scan
means our idea
scan line lie
line lie inside
line which lie
sections which lie
line some portions
multiplye such areas
out which portions
portions are inside
out which regions
parts of scan
line we obtain
line with polygon
aand then sort
sort these intersections
intersections from left
order from left
right in terms

right in increasing
four different intersections
thisthe interesting property
means you form
form a pair
pixels within pairs
shift the scan
obtain one pair
numbers of intersections
general the number
pairs i repeat
polygon and draw
draw arbitrary scan
arbitrary scan lines
general even numbers
piece of paper
intersections they canso
form two pairs
shift thise scan

require special handling
two different edges
edges as intersections
basically one intersection
intersection is formed
vertices require special
typically in general
numbers soay assuming

fill within pairs
fill ah ahthe
four filling pixels
form one pair
soso fill means
fill means fill
means fill pixels
fill pixels equivalent
draw pixel command
draw line draw

representations in fact
arbitrary polygon assuming
assuming the polygon
remember any polygon
polygon we talked
operation the summation
coordinates we talk
remember this equations
multiply and submit
equal to summation
form please check
normal the significance
origin the plane
normal other words

compute the remember
concept of octrees
two d quadtree
node which represent
zeroth sub node
zeroth sub quadrant
quadrant representation quarter

four levels thirty
two d remember
line or vertical
line it doesn
planes coordinate planes
room any volume
matter any cube
cube any rectangular
parallelopiped any subspace

case of octrees
wise the planes
equivalently smaller cube
voxel so octrees
two d region
sort of sequence
volume the zeroth
zeroth unit volume

level in fact
visualize this octree
watching the show
show is build
represent the sub
side i repeat
break the zeroth
zeroth unit sub
entire zeroth sub
zeroth sub volume
four are represent
objects by planes
build up octrees
out its equivalent
centimeter length breadth
solids um rigid
cubes cylinders spheres
talked about boolean
difference you remember
remember them union
solids not model
model points lines
primitives instant shapes
levels we assume
classes even today
parallelopiped a sphere
pyramid so assume
decide to make
two parts union
pyramid with rectangular
throwing hanging lines
objects view polygon
interpenetrate just touch
out i leave
check the eulers
structure so constructive
cylinder a black
plane it depends
structures a cylinder

larger rectangular parallelopiped
primitives the geometrical
theorems on simple
cube cone cylinder
give this operations
operations a difference
structure so lets
boolean set expression

parallelopiped and position
cube one rectangular
create this csg
two different object
means at lowest

two objects solids
sphere cone cylinder
criterias to evaluate
discussed about csg
csg using regularized
representations and octrees
represent in addition
read a concepts
concepts about primitive
dimension to define
limitations of times
approximation so coming
octrees and polygonal
smooth bounding surface
surface is curve
lots of corrugative
surfaces so octrees
approximation for objects
surfaces but constructive
represent this solids
solids high regular
high regular objects
octrees and boundary
representations octree guarantee
reps for representing
representation also change
validate that means
boundary representations bsp
representations bsp trees
didn t discussed
valid we looked
generalized eulers equations

bresenham s midpoint
steps the equations
out the increments
increments necessary based
expression implicit form
calculate to find
south east remember
coordinates incremental half
passes through closer
iteration d start
four a fractional
typically the scenario
midpoint so choice
comparing with minus
integers and comparison
circle algorithm don
initial condition put
put x equal
draw circle takes
select east remember
two x minus
east you decrement
choice of ahh
draw circle commands
circle commands draw
amo the draw
screen the raster
ten first point
initialization first direct
first direct initialization
direct initialization involves
remember the increments
show a stage
ten as selected
hold a value
thich h value

two y values
initial values mind
stops with selecting
first three statements
iteration they pick
ten the ahh
two comma ten
table theee value
updated since ahh
four and twenty
two and twenty
hmm and check
ten that means
change which occur
south east correct
pixel here south
table bottom row
two y infact
east you remember
remember the delta
expression two multiplied
fourteen six minus
twenty is minus
minus fourteen minus
seventeen minus twenty
twenty will give
calculations otherwise work
two y incremented
east the theech
repeat again delta
east so select
stage is progressing

yellow brownish color
sixth iteration based
ten is eighteen
minus eighteen term
twelve seventeen minus
showing these point
octant the draw
octants this purple
worry the circle
aliasing on jaggies
origin the center
equation being non
iteration okay compared
atleast one multiplication
remember the midpoint
main problem requires
problem requires atleast
multiplication three addition
addition per pixel
line the delta

drawing algorithm bresenham
term the first
possibility second order
calculate second order
choose again east
differences the first
two successive operation
successive operation east
order difference easiest
differences east east
east ok east
two xp cancels
order three stages
points one east

choice again east
hope you havs
east the point
south east equal
differences will give
east in fact
east the difference
integer coordinates integer
coordinates integer values
integer values excuse
values second order
differences are integer
integer it helps
increments first order
values five minus
initialal lisation part
unlike three steps
statements here draw
integers four values
four i hope
four you increment
increment h increment
condition select south
increment x draw
remember the calculations
calculations some multiplication
two y peh
loop you increment
steps first point
ten no doubt
east two values
ten is minus
color will give
logic the first
east you choose
south east choose
minus fifteen increment
two is minus
eleven very straight
ten is chosen
ten first iteration
first iteration give
two the first
eleven and minus
minus nine give
south east minus
east minus thirteen
minus eleven minus
eleven minus eleven
iteration a south
negative so choose
eleven is incremented
blue color minus
eleven will give
fifteen delta south
positive so choose
fifteen to seventeen
east this delta
four is equal
iteration it involve
involve only integer
subtraction one integer
unlike the previous
two three times
loop we didn
integer manipulation delta

circle first order
midpoint ellipse drawing
efficiently as fast
drawing points pixels
criteria or bresenham
two different criterias
points the last
earlier that circle
correct so today
midpoint criteria bresenham
bresenham s drawing
methods can conversion
bother in fact
axis and intercepts
axis the equation
case intercept running
order three quadrants
octant you remember
symmetry seven points
symmetry so applying
out one fourth
grid in region
chosen the choice
based on bresenham
axis the points
repeat the tangent
unity that means
means in negative
bresenham s criteria
criteria but integer
symmetry that means
two this helps
points ah points
case the first
curve is minus
demarcate the region
parts one belonging
regions the choice
grad function differential
function differential remember
function the grad
boundary the point
ellipse the partial
two and remember
occurs we switch
redefine these term
variable d start
direction and minus
midpoint the curve
pixel the midpoint
line in previous
case also ahh
negative a boolean
minus half respective
half respective coordinate
lot of terms
four xp minus
two whole square
south east midpoint
out that term
two please check
square minus half
half whole square
terms were important
important first order
remembering these first
quadrant the points
changed pre substituted
four b square
two keep checking
satisfied we start
incrementing keep choosing
pixel the curve
slope is infact
two but based
minus one factor
fact that remains
half yk minus
break open expression
square a square
negative that means
simple to write
subscript meanings south
meanings south east
east two means
two means region
two and south
region two lets
south the value
incremented by half
order difference south
difference south east
east one delta
two under region
two different region
peer of choices
passing here east
stop we started
init initial value
attributes drawing attributes
passing but main
main two parameters
regions and define
two ah integer
increments all right
quantities they functions
evaluated i due
plotting is done
done by ellipse
ellipse the color
gray shade umm
points symmetrical pixel
hope you follow
stop the terminating
variable here region
quadrant and ellipse
completes the method
ellipse it doesn

ordering or drawing
spend the first
order differences version
environment a programming
made in integer
two any region
region any choice
version one midpoint
version of midpoint
remember the version
circle so attempt
symmetry and scan
interval minus ten
ten okay iinteger
ten to minus
cube by twelve
typical the case

methology behind polyfill
raster film buffer
fill a polygon
lines using bresenham
values that lie
line the scan
points are pixels
lets us assume
vertices one vertex
vertex two vertex
framework or steps
coordinates the minimum
enclosed rectangle correct
difference the number
step is obtain
visualize the arbitrary
multiple such areas
number that means
numbers the number
polygon the shape
intersections otherwise typical
typical in general
number say assuming
first pair leave
pair so fill
intersection points don
algorithm of bresenham
easy the concept
similar the bresenham
matter you find
enclosed rectangle find
right form pairs
started y min
point you don
concepts of bresenham
algorithm basically intersection
scan line correct
point the cursor
number the pixel
points on scan
out the intersecting
number of uus
idea that odd
pill fill polygon
fill polygon works
cases of scanline
scanline is passing
four ah intersection
four just increment
center the number
scanline which shows
whats the problem
find an vertex
odd number odd
number odd number
means we don
don t add
algorithm is stepped
vertex we don
add means add
scanline y prime
dot we don
vertex of scanline
purple color top
color top scanline
side same side
bottom this case
side of scanline
bottom also bottom
clear we talking
intersection of scanline
edge coming meeting
meeting the scanline
case we don
case for scanline
fact this scanline
scanline y passes
vertex and scanline
polygon you traverse
move clockwise half
clockwise the typical
clockwise or anti
starts you traverse
unidirectional that means
vertices y coordinate
condition if endpoint
clockwise that means
upwards x value
number of scanline
term monotonically increasing
counter clockwise form
shared vertex represent
vertex the first
condition means top
means top condition
satisfy i repeat
polygon for scanline
side in fact
extrema that means
extreme that means
polygon this figure
basically three scanlines
done while processing
don t process
changing that means
short of processing
bottom bottom top
bottom top doesn
matter you reduce
shorten the lower
edge to ensure
doesn t reach
vertex and hencefore
revisit the scanline
visit it intersect
intersect polygon edges
intersection and basic
basic of culture
form y min
bottom intersects scanline
edge short intersections
polygon edges fill
priory by shortening
increment this scanline
edge creech vertices
incremental scanline based
scanline based algorithm
intersections form pairs
edge sort intersections
loop between scanlines
similar to bresenham
midpoint criterias similar
coherence in scanline
handle these problem
problem of vertices
scanline intersection points
class for scanline
equations the concept
intersections and filling
vertices needs special
intersect the scanline
intercepts fill pair
number one don
don t fill
scanline then intersection
two to intersection
scanline coherence scanline
coherence scanline coherence
values typically don
coherence the intersection
value also doesn
repeat again values
previous one lets
minus one doesn
thi this means
concepts from bresenham
scanline the bottom
command using bresenham
computed easily first
exploit is similar
lecture little bit
bresenham s scanline
algorithm we avoided
point calculations remember
understood the bresenham
delta c delta
scanlines the successive
increment that means
point we increment
crosses that reduce
decrement you increase

examples following examples
show typical contrast
format the original
image of lena
push to larger
function were darker
values are push
nature were darker
gray level image
bright darker pixels
contrast stretching operations
function transformation function
good the media
stiffer the curve
images are good
equalization based technique
algorithm on histogram
introduce this variables
levels this variable
pgpr level value
image so lets
hundred and brighter
images of moderate
simulation toolbox image
toolbox image processing
huge required large
required large number
image it doesn
information the global
white that image
remember this global
properties that means
automatic even computing
cdf or cumulative
mathematically the discrete
remember the integral
values rk normalized
integral this integral
histogram calculate normalized
calculate normalized sum
case i encourage
divide seven ninety
curve that area
column so lets
function its sum
don t reach
compute this quantized
domain we don
four four decimal
four decimal value
values um gray
combine the previous
twenty three pixels
fifty six pixels
right now point
previous slide lets
values the image
equalization algorithm lets
image ok lets
values no pixels
nature here large
mind the first
histogram is equalize
number of grey
submerge in water
bit become brighter
brighter in including
bad so histogram
image compression segmentation
compression segmentation enhancement
difference in fact
worsen the quality
image is saturated
perform a histogram
domain the simplest
cross three template
values three cross
ten and eleven
eleven or lesser
average on replace
cross seven window
window the effect
spike noisy lets
eleven i put
node that means
noise so average
noise it works
compute into simple
filtering to short
short those twenty
four six cross
guess i leave
forty nine gray
fifty one good
simply nine pixel
values and replace
replaced by twelve
shifted to end
out this spike
larger the mask
eleven cross eleven
larger window size
edge will disappear
hand nine pixels
sort this values
value twenty lets
pixels three cross
filtering it preserves
spuriousness few information
done the idea
noise it degrades
powerful so lets

condition are good
direction but remember
algorithm are situation
negative set directions
culling the main
good the computerization
face culling drawback
percent about fifty
compute these normal
algorithm which involves
ray tracing photometry
talk ray tracing
ray tracing radio
tracing radio city
radio city photometry
play significant role
doubt back face
method i told
