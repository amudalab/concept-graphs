networks good day
day ! today
talk about telecom
networks that means
means the kind
kind of network
discuss this telecom
sense that first
network even today
wide area communication
exclusive data networks
evolution of telecom
alexander graham bell
graham bell developed
developed the first
couple of telephone
telephone instruments connected
taking this principle
connecting the wires
pair of telephones
good long-term strategy
jungle of wires
difficult to manage
central switching office
operator could connect
connect one telephone
number of wires
matter of fact
approximately n2 kind
kind of links
number of links
question of connecting
connecting them individually
connect to subscriber
finally a connection
connection is made
user could connect
town by cranking
cranking a handle
movies or movies
depicting an older
crank crank crank
ring some kind
bell or give
give some indication
office the switch
person and find
subscriber tells connect
operator would connect
connect this subscriber
person was replaced
sort of prepares
wanted to connect
necessarily her husband
designed some kind
kind of electromechanical
relays and mechanical
switches would sort
sort of rotate
side and connect
connect this electromechanical
electromechanical exchange served
exchanges were operating
replaced by electronic
make a connection
make a physical
physical copper connection
local exchange building
local exchange switch
kind of signal
connecting this part
loop in telephone
analog carrier systems
types of wires
sort of connecting
connecting the premise
kind of black
kind of cables
cables these category
hut are connected
exchange where switching
switching is done
switching ? suppose
suppose this user
pairs of wires
switch would connect
naturally people found
apparent that callers
talk to people
people in neighbouring
solved the first
pairs of telephones
local switching office
two different towns
two different locations
problem ; first
large so irrespective
put your exchange
lot of wires
step in telecom
connect every telephone
number of towns
single switching office
so-called trunk exchanges
number of local
fashion automatic switching
automatic switching office
switching office enables
office enables connections
means your connection
exchange that means
make a local
caller and callee
two different local
exchanges are connected
exchange would connect
exchange would make
make the connection
connections are set
telecom grew bigger
bigger and bigger
levels of hierarchy
wanted to talk
countries to cope
tiers were added
hierarchy to make
make a call
dial a number
number this number
number is examined
higher level switching
level switching office
public switched telephone
switched telephone network
exchanges these trunk
exchanges would connect
lots of calls
two local exchanges
making a local
making a call
make an std
main trunk exchange
exchange of west
exchange of bihar
two from kolkata
kolkata to patna
patna main trunk
main trunk exchanges
high speed lines
local trunk exchange
exchange at kolkata
exchange in bihar
making isd calls
question of routing
routing a telephone
telephone call routing
telephone call means
exchange to trunk
make some provision
problem of routing
route a telephone
call in older
older telephone systems
made a call
call the switching
switching office set
path is set
call is routed
level switching offices
reaches a switching
reach the destination
telephone by connecting
connecting with lower
lower level switching
offices the switching
switching offices examine
examine the digits
number you dialed
dialed to make
make these connections
sense fairly simple
numbers are distributed
making an std
call in india
callee ; digit
fairly methodical manner
kolkata trunk exchange
caller is connected
make any sense
first few digits
making a connection
kolkata to delhi
suppose from kolkata
so-called subscriber trunk
subscriber trunk dialing
main tax exchange
exchange in kolkata
kolkata in order
order to connect
exchange in delhi
makes the connection
first two digits
digits and decide
last few digits
country to find
makes the routing
routing problem easy
digits and make
talking about connections
essentially telephone service
sort of changing
majority of telephone
points is maintained
number the path
kind of virtual
path is maintained
number of advantages
means the quality
quality of service
bandwidth this channel
contention for bandwidth
bandwidth by multiple
time-being so first
bandwidth is held
service is good
good second thing
path is held
message bits arrive
reserved and held
bits may arrive
traditional telephone circuit
means actual physical
actual physical connections
connections are made
system the downside
total available bandwidth
bandwidth the reason
factors ? considerable
channel is lying
lying idle remember
call is held
sort of inefficient
bandwidth another problem
due to historical
traditional telephone equipment
rate of development
development of technology
generation of technology
tremendous cost benefit
cost benefit advantage
benefit advantage compared
computer technology started
technology started leading
leading the technology
traditional telecom technology
technology was steady
computer communication field
so-called connectionless service
talking about connection-oriented
service in telephone
technology in telephones
traditional service providers
slowly now depending
sort of sprang
service ? connectionless
service is packet-by-packet
packet of data
packet is sort
sort of thrown
system and routed
path this connection
advantage of connectionless
traditional circuit switch
circuit switch systems
technology in terms
terms of silicon
pricing is lower
telephone service people
kind of technology
care to guarantee
address in order
routed ip networks
networks are based
based on packet
packet switching technologies
techniques are employed
service the technology
technology being cheaper
beginning to dominate
dominate all networks
mentioned this earlier
network for data
data from computers
wide area networks
area networks traffic
traffic still rides
sort of made
connection is dedicated
kinds of technology
networks and telecom
process of routing
kinds of calls
media in telephone
talked little bit
details in traditional
traditional analog telephone
analog telephone systems
systems the telephone
telephone is connected
exchange via category
higher bandwidth cables
carry multiple telephone
multiple telephone calls
cables for separate
calls specifically digital
specifically digital lines
lines on fiber
technique called frequency
frequency division multiplexing
remember the earlier
local connection hut
hut a fat
basically a collection
collection of pairs
pairs of cables
connected through individual
bunch of pairs
cables that run
pairs of copper
copper cables running
lot of calls
kinds of multiplexing
specifically time division
today a fiber
two big cities
cities a lot
lot of subscriber
accommodate a large
number of channels
connected through fiber
calls are sort
sort of multiplexed
division multiplex fashion
individual copper pairs
handsets are powered
derives its power
coming and connecting
connecting your telephone
full duplex communication
remember we talked
duplex and full
duplex communication half
communication half duplex
half duplex communication
duplex communication means
communication we require
require some kind
kind of echo
modems for sending
sending digital data
loop being analog
bit of implications
communicate digital data
context of computer
connect a computer
computer produces digital
produces digital data
modulated and demodulated
demodulated so modems
pairs for sending
sending the digital
line you remember
lines are designed
designed to handle
rate for communication
sampled at doubled
doubled the rate
bits per sample
indicating the level
sending a computer
kbps speed people
speed people talk
speed because depending
connections are weak
lot of noise
noise so depending
negotiate a lower
find the lower
fully analog technology
multiplexing techniques higher
in-between for connecting
connecting between exchanges
bunch of codecs
codecs for coders
coders and decoders
coding and decoding
convert the analog
signal is ready
signals to reach
reach its final
bit about signaling
mention some names
basically what signaling
signaling is signaling
exchange between terminal
routers for setting
setting up circuits
advanced network services
making a telephone
making a simple
simple voice call
voice should communicate
order to achieve
sort of switches
routers and multiplexers
exchange some information
information for basic
kinds of services
service provider side
bill a person
making the connections
capture those digits
order to make
part of signaling
types of signaling
sort of converging
standards in common
common channel signaling
interfere with voice
signaling is done
call is set
channel signaling works
purpose that means
signal is converted
converted to digital
make a frame
stuff this frame
control purpose ss7
widely accepted standard
out of band
plane that means
connection is taking
network of switch
controllers ; first
network of subscribers
primary service-giving network
network but overlaid
kinds of extra
advanced signaling system
local exchange supports
means his telephone
answer his call
make a note
end ? circuit
caller id number
kinds of intelligent
signaling that means
arbitrarily complex message
complex message transfer
kind of states
quiescent that means
services have improved
exchange then finds
finds some resource
resource to serve
finds the resource
exchange is ready
ready to receive
receive the numbers
dial some numbers
simply a local

handled by digital
convert the digital
back into analog
older analog technology
network is digital
attempts to make
make this digital
integrated service digital
service digital network
isdn was envisaged
end-to-end digital service
means it starts
end now home
important because people
connected by cat
difficult and costly
proposition to change
rate for isdn
isdn for higher
primary rate equivalent
system uses out-of-band
network terminating device
local passive bus
