good day today
talking about local
internetworking ? internetworking
term internet today
internet today internet
connecting different networks
broadcast domain form
form a network
connected through routers
set of nodes
domain this broadcast
broadcast is advantageous
discover the mac
send an arp
address that means
out the mac
address that mac
data link layer
link layer frame
internetworking is required
advantage of interconnection
interconnection similar type
type of computers
computers can communicate
two networks connected
routes between nodes
create alternative communication
alternative communication routes
reason for local
capacity to isolate
find the mac
network is large
computers get connected
nodes are sending
sending broadcast messages
messages the network
scope of broadcast
broadcast becomes limited
referring to broadcast
access the information
information on remote
advantages of connecting
glimpsed earlier suppose
send a message
two different lans
connection a router
kind of network
device that enables
lans to communicate
discuss the basics
discuss the network
two arp tables
tables in router
network in routing
table at source
find the router
host must find
router for finding
finding the router
sense to human
bunch of bytes
router in order
order to send
two hardware adapters
adapters should communicate
address or mac
arp and find
creates a datagram
datagram with source
network layer address
creates link layer
address as destination
link layer sends
sends the frame
layer will receive
receive this frame
adaptor r removes
removes ip datagram
link layer header
header and trailer
physical layer address
communicate with lan
arp in lan
creates a frame
source ip address
4-byte ip address
source mac address
router router finds
finds the mac
forms the net
couple more slides
slides for finishing
finishing this arp
arp when sending
sending an arp
request the sender
address and mac
address all machines
network can extract
extract the bindings
traffic and store
extracts and puts
bypass the arp
doing a broadcast
system can notify
address by sending
protocol that hides
hides the underlying
arbitrary ip address
physical network system
accommodate various systems
arp uses variable
variable length packets
part of arp
arp message format
hardware address length
classes of hardware
kinds of networks
address length mentioned
byte ; protocol
protocol address length
length is mentioned
bytes of arp
arp ; i.e
rarp ? rarp
stands for reverse
arp ? arp
address and rarp
address ? rarp
rarp is required
locally and specifically
specifically one place
diskless machines nowadays
concept of diskless
server these thin
easier to maintain
cheaper to upgrade
easier to upgrade
upgrade one central
bunch of pcs
local and give
give that mac
server will assign
server like arp
frame the frame
primary and back-up
back-up rarp servers
two other protocols
protocols like bootp
bootp and dhcp
successors of rarp
talk about bootp
two different networks
internetworking is local
require the full
link layer device
discussing about bridges
bridges today bridges
bridges can connect
connect different networks
matter of fact
bridge can connect
value ; i.e
locally connected small
connected small lans
lan is big
protocol from ieee
tree of bridges
protocols are organized
discuss wireless networks
networks a bridge
bridge may connect
connect different types
types of networks
spanning tree protocol
discuss the spanning
tree protocol presently
local internetwork picture
two bridges bridge
connecting to lan
device it stores
stores and forwards
forwards ethernet frames
address these bridges
handle the hardware
addresses it examines
examines frame headers
selectively forwards frames
based on mac
mac destination address
address this means
address and decide
forwarded on segment
access the segment
bridges are transparent
hosts are unaware
presence of bridges
transparent and plug-and-play
self-learning and start
efficiency will improve
learns more bridges
advantage a bridge
bridge separates lans
traffic to remain
reasons like security
issues to maintain
maintain the traffic
boosts the signal
regenerates the signal
forwarding the signal
highly advantageous bridges
ethernet-to-ethernet or token
token ring-to-token ring
convert between protocols
ethernet-to-token ring protocol
ring protocol conversion
bridges also bridges
inadequate for large
stores the hardware
hardware addresses observed
information to learn
learn which frames
maintain a table
packet from lan
machine in lan
bridge has physical
table it learns
learns which frame
bridges forward information
form of packets
host is connected
connected to bridges
bridges can construct
recently been forwarded
learns and fills
host is moved
system is moved
moved from lan
network interface card
machine from lan
address has moved
moved from lan1
lan1 to lan
data remain fresh
fresh and relevant
connecting multiple lans
connect multiple lans
problem of looping
redundant alternative paths
paths from source
source to destination
forward frames forever
forever the frame
frame getting dropped
frame starts circulating
increase in numbers
acceptable the solution
tree by disabling
subset of interfaces
graph as shown
graph its nodes
segments and bridges
edges are bridge-to-segment
constructed now construct
construct a tree
original graph keeping
keeping all segment
nodes and removing
removing some bridge
nodes and edges
edges the individual
individual lan segments
form an edge
edge this graph
cycles we remove
remove the cycles
keeping the graph
links to avoid
nodes are retained
disabled to avoid
graph with lots
lots of cycles
graph still remains
spanning tree algorithm
algorithm from ieee
decides which ports
network is acyclic
resulting network interconnects
interconnects all segments
assume each bridge
root bridge forwards
bridge forwards packets
non-root bridges compute
compute the shortest
path to root
algorithms are distributed
locally available knowledge
centralized or traditional
difficult to write
write distributed algorithms
write a distributed
algorithm a node
computation only based
form a global
form that global
picture each lan
single designated bridge
designated bridge closest
closest to root
bridge all packets
lan are forwarded
bridges exchange configuration
exchange configuration messages
messages to determine
determine spanning tree
manner the configuration
distance in hops
hops from message
cm-1 identifies root
root with smaller
cm-1 is closer
closer to root
identify same root
root and distance
sender has smaller
cm-1 is preferred
initially all bridges
roots and generate
root and send
send initiating cms
reach the root
number of hops
determine true root
compute the distance

algorithm will converge
tree that connects
connects all segments
run this spanning
isolate the traffic
specifically broadcast traffic
traffic so bridge
bridge installation breaks
installation breaks lan
lan into lan
bridges filter packets
packets same lan
lan segment frames
segments hence segments
segments become separate
separate collision domains
divided into lan
segment to forward
forward the message
table and entry
node lan address
stamp the node
min for ttl
interface without traffic
frame is received
learns the location
incoming lan segment
records sender location
sender location pair
pair in bridge
receives a frame
forms an index
index bridge table
table using mac
entry is found
found for destination
frame had arrived
drops the frame
frame is meant
bridge will forward
machine is connected
flood flooding means
flooding means forwarding
forwarding the frame
destination mac address
segment this mac
mac address belongs
flooding many packets
suppose c sends
sends a frame
notes in bridge
sender mac address
send the frames
frames into interfaces
earlier the frame
frame gets copied
host will ignore
ignore that frame
generates a frame
