looked at copper
optical fibers optical
fibers optical fiber
basically is made
made of glass
transparent silica glass
tens of kilometers
kind of transparency

standards for making
making this glass
simply a glass
drawn into fiber
fiber for giving
fiber at moderate
light is restricted
total internal reflection
reflection for ordinary
guide for lasers
single-mode fiber multimode
fiber multimode fibers
wide area networks
networks these days
days single-mode fibres
preferred for carrying
fibers or free

favor fiber optics
optics a lot
make much sense
ultimately be dictated
kind of boxes
electronics now electronics
kind of speed
