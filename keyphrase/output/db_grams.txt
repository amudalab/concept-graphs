introduction to database
year under graduate
systems probably operating
concepts are required
duration and expected
covering the transacting
transacting processing system
instructor dr srinath
covering the initial
sections on database
design er modeling
lecture is give
introduction to databases
databases and show
show the importance
importance of databases
data in digital
mode of data
stored by corporates
organizations as increased
terabytes now databases
day today life
lot of transactions
day today transactions
airline ticket reservation
reservation or withdrawal
withdrawal of money
store the costumer
form of databases
transactions like withdrawal
bank or reserving
reserving a ticket
business processing world
entity in terms
terms of developing
developing these applications
business process applications
applications to show
show what kind
database have assumed
assumed in recent
life i realized
realized only yesterday
pay a premium
paying this policy
lic actually sends
paper copy posted
paying the premium
carry the cash
physically now move
doing this transaction
access this data
pay the premium
box which means
office without moving
finish this entire
entire business transaction
call as work
flow to show
flow actually takes
show you online
user the ability
ability to login
basically try login
earlier with lic
calculate the lone
paid which shows
paid already online
database actually shows
single point access
online premium payment
choose the policies
lot of options
amount of premium
paying this premium
make this payment
city bank debit
bank debit card
sbi net banking
bank of india
database of state
login into state
india s database
give my details
paying this money
money to lic
verify and confirm
confirm life insurance
life insurance con
insurance con transactions
con transactions detail
rupees and date
branch is indian
pay to lic
lic for paying
paying my premium
back to lic
view or print
print a confirmation
mail id provided
requirements to show
paid this premium
receipt which tells
signed by lic
receipt is generated
generated by lic
databases and doing
doing business transactions
paid this amount
amount to lic
lic and lic
received this amount
lots of issues
customer is protected
reflex this payment
execute this online
online sitting right
done very late
pay this premium
data is digitized
digitized and exposed
extremely important subject
applications and making
making them usable
life by people
examples also exists
clear trip dot
similarly make payments
payments and buy
buy your tickets
things with respect
respect to booking
booking your reservations
reservations and things
examples or principles
principles in developing
developing these kinds
kinds of databases
half an hour
developing these kind
kind of applications
develop a database
process within iit
madras the business
people to purchase
purchase computer systems
systems and peripherals
faculty of iit
supply these peripherals
purchase these systems
supply of computer
peripherals and computer
process is done
vendors can bid
points of times
vendor is chosen
rate contract system
changing in terms
quote at regular
computer system configuration
things are chosen
systems are chosen
choose whatever systems
generate the required
papers for purchasing
purchasing those systems
paper based system
supply their quotes
quotes on paper
word processing system
system like microsoft
microsoft word providing
providing a comparative
basically file systems
lot of processing
processing of entering
entering these data
involves a tds
choose the systems
entire process starting
lot of manual
circulation of large
quantity of papers
two various members
involved in choosing
choosing these things
processing by choosing
introducing data base
data base systems
systems for automating
automating the entire
entire business process
process or work
processes or work
work flow elements
first cut requirement
developed to show
sort of automated
introduce the database
automating this business
rate contract details
members in choosing
choosing their requirements
search through computer
configuration or add
add on parts
parts or space
space for computer
systems or printers
printers and scanners
scanners and note
note book computers
iit specification number
specification number wise
specification will give
search through vendor
click on specification
wise and submit
choose the fourth
specification and submit
submit that specification
company infotech limited
limited which quoted
cpu clock speed
submit this quote
canonical electronics private
electronics private limited
matching this requirement
satisfies my requirement
back end database
access that data
accessing the data
retrieve the data
data which matches
match the required
values and retrieving
retrieving the data
navigate through data
data which means
number is concerned
choosing which means
information that satisfies
registered my database
students who registered
ways we retrieve
retrieve this data
iit serial number
company name unit
price without monitor
data now lot
lot of information
organized as flat
storing the data
kind of data
model or real
real world data
world data model
store the information
information about maruti
object data model
kind of engine
parts that engine
terms of objects
flat table base
table base model
relational database system
applications that fit
model for building
building this computer
computer rate contract
relational model fits
developing the application
enables the vendors
enabled this database
vendor to login
give a guest
enter my system
kinds of specifications
list of specifications
decides his specification
give this information
supply that information
information here unit
basically can give
put some comments
decided to quote
basically the entire
entire relational database
database system concept
system concept makes
concept makes sense
doing this update
make my decisions
processes or transaction
transaction to access
quotation is registered
situated in delhi
parts of chennai
quotes that quote
processes and transaction
challenges are conceptual
understanding in building
understand this application
store this data
data or create
create my tables
make the transactions
created a database
mysql relational database
tables and store
store the database
database underneath server
put my data
key database system
creating this rate
rate contract rc-april
storing the information
quotations for add
add on systems
quotation for computer
table and approved
quotations for note
books and approved
quotation for printers
sense they form
form the schema
critical in database
study as part
design my database
point for design
people who select
vendors have quoted
attributes these entities
quotations for computers
break an entity
registered with iit
madras then vendors
create this information
converting this entity
thing like users
information on company
designing your database
convert the entities
entities into tables
store this information
terms of converting
converting an entity
information is duplicated
duplication of data
data will create
piece of fact
fact at multiple
lot of problems
database design concepts
concepts will explain
process of design
entity relationship diagram
design my system
case of quotations
bulk price bulk
bulk two prices
number of systems
additional with monitor
kind of monitor
schemas also changed
tomorrow i don
bulk two price
longer my requirement
computer which means
understand as schema
business processes evolved
evolved and systems
systems evolved schema
deal with databases
earlier in terms
browse the entire
systems which quoted
price they didn
comments for people
viewsonic or acer
acer tft monitors
data gets changed
guest and quoted
information is reflected
vat is extra
flow is concerned
information whatever people
people have quoted
quoted and pick
pick whatever quotations
quotations for examples
examples for computers
reflect the approved
systems for computer
organized in terms
pick the informations
detail how transactions
data and change
change the state
shown you earlier
first level search
choose a specification
make a query
submit that thing
reads the data
read only transactions
database and reading
reading the information
browser so lot
lot of thing
carry the database
information and show
show this information
read only transaction
reading the values
kind of transactions
sort of quote
give some data
updating our underneath
database which means
database to summarize
design the underneath
models and store
store the data
accessing this data
data and supporting
supporting various business
allowing my vendors
vendors to quote
database and allowing
allowing my faculty
faculty to choose
order the related
related computer systems
entire business processing
data is automated
underlining database system
critical in terms
terms of supporting
automating this processes
processes and eliminating
eliminating manual processing
processing and manual
simple and elegant
elegant and nice
handling our business
business processing systems
meaning of transactions
maintain the consistency
develop these systems
systems and make
day to day
covered in depth
design of databases
databases using model
today are based
database are tables
modeling for databases
order to answer
answer that question
typical database design
database design process
captures the gist
talk about databases
remember that databases
database is embedded
embedded so databases
embedded within railway
railway reservation solution
information system context
universe of discourse
discourse the universe
discourse basically tells
blocks that make
talk about designing
designing a database
uod and collecting
make an analysis
conduct its operations
kinds of operations
identifies a correct
kinds of requirements
requirements the first
imagined that database
requirements are handled
handled by dbms
solution to give
build a car
build a bus
larger information system
high-level conceptual design
understandable by human
understand the problems
computer so database
taking up today
requirements so functional
functions ? opening
opening an account
function or making
making a bank
constraints that holdup
holdup these functions
analyses are made
high-level transaction specifications
specifications in fact
revisiting this topic
topic called transactions
club different operations
transaction now transactions
dbms independent process
meant by dbms
means that doesn
mysql or postgres
understand your uod
dbms dependent processes
two different streams
schema in turn
design actually tells
data itself resides
dbms dependent process
standards that exists
stores its data
physical design results
similarly the high-level
high-level transactions specifications
impact the physical
suppose certain kinds
kinds of operation
sense to design
slightly lose fashion
easier to handle
high-level transaction specs
specs in order
order to make
make your physical
similarly the application
application program design
design and transaction
finally the application
important for database
understand our uod
discourse it tells
kinds of data
handle and based
requirements do users
building banking solution
customers or account
kinds of logs
logs and ledgers
ledgers and account
represent some kinds
design would identify
includes the description
entities that makeup
makeup the uod
bank the customer
railway reservation system
kinds of entity
types so customer
holds an account
account in order
make a term
imposed by physics
modeling a railway
two trains starting
kinds of constraints
constraints that exist
exist among data
thing to note
details here note
schema is ease
ease of understanding
understand your understanding
communication with end
things we identify
company has departments
speaking to employees
project may span
span different departments
two different kinds
kinds of things
things like departments
colon like departments
projects are entity
entities say department
manager or location
entity that means
means they belong
occurring after department
department here belongs
department id belongs
similarly the project
project id belongs
belongs to project
project and address
belongs to employee
date of birth
paying income taxes
gender and date
entity relationship model
notation of representing
representing entity types
types are represented
represented by rectangles
rectangles so department
entity and attributes
department like department
form of ovals
represents an object
independent existence note
note that term
term independent existence
identify an entity
entity because address
entity called employee
employee or department
independently occurring object
entity has attributes
properties that describe
describe the characteristic
kinds of attributes
age and date
classify this attributes
classifications of attributes
attributes is simple
simple versus composite
back one value
title and nick
composite attribute versus
versus a simple
find many colors
defined by multiple
closely is made
denote color blue
types so multi-valued
attributes versus derived
versus derived attributes
attributes now stored
give some date
database however suppose
employee now suppose
today s date
derive the age
employee so age
good database design
design would put
today an employee
attributes or null
values for attributes
suppose a student
two elective courses
two different slots
give a grade
unknown or missing
value that means
write in application
back to entities
entities and define
respect to entity
word entity type
defined this term
definition or defines
defines a collection
entity type department
department it means
represents all departments
real world object
world object type
collection of entities
departments plus accounting
department now suppose
collection we call
two different departments
type as opposed
type is set
set to describe
describe the schema
entity or entities
attributes that means
systems programming department
designated as manager
entity type describes
representations entities types
types are defined
defined by boxes
boxes and attributes
attributes are defined
defined by ovals
kinds of ovals
similarly derived attributes
talking about entity
identifier and manager
manager and address
identify each department
department no matter
supplies and accounts
accounts and suppose
department called administration
code in post
identifies each entity
department id attribute
attribute is unique
department that belonging
uniquely identify entities
attributes or keys
case all attributes
attributes which form
set of attributes
case the key
key is made
made by combining
key is minimal
supplies is redundant
redundant we don
identify a department
minimal in nature
nature no subset
attributes are shown
properties of keys
enhanced er model
retention of key
identify an element
key should open
identify a house
identify a machine
identify the machine
keys that define
define any kind
weak entity types
types or entities
relationship in order
order to define
meant by domain
domain of attributes
domain to put
set of rules
years and greater
years the domain
basically a number
nature imposed restriction
defines the space
attribute can reside
attribute is cartesian
domains of individual
types like department
composed of first
concept that important
notion of relationships
entities and relationships
attributes and keys
keys and domains
precise relationship type
relationship type defines
defines a relationship
shows a relationship
entity type employee
relationship type specifies
entity of type
make some definitions
meant by relationship
type so relationship
number of entities
entities and defines
defines a set
set of associations
means an entity
instance or entity
entity or entity
define one instance
meant by relationships
characteristics that define
simply the number
establish an association
earlier a relationship
type of degree
department is managed
entities that participate
managed by relationship
relationship such kinds
kinds of relationships
two entity types
entity types involved
types of relationships
carefully the first
picture above shows
shows the relationship
shows employee works
works for department
picture below shows
entity and department
attribute of employee
department an attribute
works in describe
describe the characteristics
departments and employees
employees have separate
existences or separate
confuse this problem
attribute because department
first picture shows
picture shows employee
attribute and put
first one correct
show that employee
separate relation depicts
depicts the relationship
relationship between employee
employee and department
characteristic that describe
attributes that describe
characteristics of employee
employee that means
sense an employee
employee entity type
relationships versus attributes
slightly a tricky
order to determine
functional data models
form of attributes
talk about relationship
relationship by storing
storing an object
object and vise
similarly in relational
study much deeper
relationships are established
table that describes
describes one kind
table is described
foreign key attribute
type is related
talking about relationship
notion of constraints
talk about relationships
relationships are defined
examples of employee
managing a department
establish a constraint
person can manage
allowed to manage
constraints from employee
employee to department
constraint from department
department to employee
talking about constraints
constraints and relationship
call as cardinality
ratios and participation
replaced this managed
relationship called works
slightly more general
general than managed
general then managed
mandate a requirement
employees can work
two different ways
employee can work
represent a cardinality
constraint or cardinality
constraint is defined
defined or constrained
cardinality or number
number of entity
kind of constraints
shows another relationship
department handles project
department may handle
project for developing
developing some kind
kind of software
existence of project
project entity type
entity type exist
project is dependent
participate it doesn
entity type existence
existence is dependent
type or participates
attributes for relationships
handles certain projects
projects and project
project totally participated
attribute called budget
project is handled
department that means
project for working
means the department
kind of relationships
move the attributes
first figure shows
move this budget
budget is allocated
lose any semantics
last things definitions
shows a figure
employee is identified
identified by pan
number so assuming
received pan number
prepare some kind
entity called insurance
record and note
weak entity type
type that means
keys the key
employee which defines
defines an insurance
insurance record forms
forms the key
relationship that defines
kind of association
insurance details identifies
details identifies insurance
identifies insurance record
ties in insurance
records with employee
record totally participates
two different entity
entity types department
department and project
project in participation
defined by double
pursue a summary
type and defined
defined by rhombus
identifying relationship types
attribute has double
meant by conceptual
database is meant
meant for non-technical
composed of diagrammatic
notations like entities
entities and attributes
entity sets attributes
attributes and key
attributes and relationships
relationships and weak
identify this entity
types and relationships
secession on conceptual
modeling of database
talking about conceptual
modeling of databases
databases in previous
start with today
today s session
looked into conceptual
typical database process
process or design
design and development
start with analyzing
analyzing the uod
set of process
process or application
gave the metaphor
car or bus
analyze the uod
uod so coming
analysis or design
database should handle
include any dbms
dbms specific terms
terms or dbms
dbms specific issues
show the end
understood by analyzing
analyzing your universe
requirement that exist
models for performing
performing this conceptualization
conceptualization or building
building a conceptual
entity relationship modeling
modeling are made
essentially two kinds
kinds of building
nuances of entities
issues that affect
constraints and attributes
describe some notation
review but review
type is described
represents a class
class of entities
entities or objects
company a department
set of entities
type called manager
type called department
attributes which describe
employee is defined
represents a space
attributes which takes
peacock it doesn
attribute an attribute
attributes like first
diagrams but key
set of employees
employees and suppose
employee identification number
income tax permanent
tax permanent account
permanent account number
identifies a person
key two persons
identification number identifies
identifies the entity
uniquely so key
key attributes identifies
identifies this entity
type a weak
kind of entity
number or pan
identify the person
key to identify
identify the insurance
identify an insurance
identifying the person
relationships between attributes
relationship basically ties
constraints that identify
identify some kinds
type can participate
managed by manager
person may manage
works in department
relationship one department
relationship an identifying
relationship that identifies
identifies a weak
strong entity type
relationship is giving
giving an identification
type called insurance
record is set
department managers project
existence of projects
projects will depend
manage this part
separate project identification
project identification number
total participation implies
participation implies identifying
implies identifying relationships
identifying relationship implies
relationship implies total
implies total participation
give us greater
expressiveness to express
perceive as relationships
relationships and associations
associations between data
sets of notations
enhanced er notations
extended er notations
notations and abbreviated
abbreviated as eer
relationships or associations
notation of subclassing
subclassing or inheritance
subclassing essentially face
shares an is-a
examples a car
car is-a vehicle
monkey is-a primate
primate is-a animal
manager is-a employee
is-a relationship identifies
identifies a specialization
type a car
vehicles are cars
class of cars
generalization of maruti
type called car
similarly a monkey
left hand side
relationship is set
specialization of entity
entities of class
generalizations of entities
properties of generalization
generalization and specialization
relationship now suppose
car that exists
entities of type
car entity type
vehicle entity type
entity that exists
set of cars
set of vehicles
classes and subclasses
subclasses undergo type
undergo type inheritance
meant by type
describe some properties
properties of vehicles
kinds of properties
vehicles ? vehicles
vehicle so assuming
road vehicles suppose
vehicle is represented
represented by wheels
kind of controlling
describe a general
class each member
super class entities
entities and participates
general class entity
class entity participates
specialized class entity
relationship that exists
exists between vehicles
replace this vehicle
change the semantics
entire database system
matter of naming
rockets and airplanes
airplanes as vehicles
replace a subclass
super class entity
class entity arises
out with inheritances
inheritances and special
generalization and specializations
kind of replacements
replacements of general
general class entities
entities with special
special class entities
establishes a correct
correct inheritance relationship
incorrect inheritance relationship
relationship is depicted
represents an inheritance
identify the manager
classes however special
attributes in addition
identify one manager
combine that attribute
attributes that form
form the key
inheritance the key
directly the process
process of creating
uod here requires
vehicles i identify
identify that van
talk to people
identify different entities
company uses cars
company uses buses
company uses motorbikes
company uses trucks
company uses vans
start seeing relationships
company is concern
straight forward process
process sometimes depending
class may change
types an airplane
airplane without engines
properties of specialization
specialization and generalization
classes the first
property of specialization
generalized class objects
specialized class objects
number of attributes
context of learning
fly a glider
glider or learning
fly an airplane
kinds of skills
learn for flying
flying an airplane
flying a glider
case that depending
plan your journey
journey and push
push a button
opposite inheritance tree
tree is valid
airplane requires smaller
requires smaller number
number of skill
requires a larger
subclass of airplane
straight forward thing
thing to identify
identify is-a relationship
ignore the application
ignore the information
context about building
building an airplane
context about flying
change the inheritance
back to specialization
identified two entity
identified an entity
type called secretary
secretary is identified
pan and salary
skills the secretary
secretary has typing
typing short hand
number a manager
kind of experience
experience the manager
entity types sharing
kind of attributes
two are similar
two are special
employee and manager
employee so note
first a part
part of secretary
secretary and manager
attributes between secretary
manager have moved
specialized classes remain
distinguish one special
class to specialized
show an entity
type called employee
defined by attributes
attributes called pan
attribute called job
two specialized classes
specialized classes secretary
secretary and professor
professor now suppose
suppose we identify
identify a property
type as academy
type called admin
category of academic
category of administrative
distinguished form entities
admin is secretary
secretary and academic
academic is professor
kinds of definitions
subclass these subclasses
subclasses are defined
predicates that exist
subclasses maybe unique
denoting this subclasses
drawn a circle
denotes the fact
subclasses are disjoined
meant by disjoint
type as admin
type of academic
classes or specialized
specialized entity types
notions of chair
supported from external
external funding sources
purposes they work
professors are chair
professors are normal
kinds of inheritance
trees or subclasses
subclasses are set
kind of overlapping
professor is concerned
doing the normal
overlap is partial
kind of generalization
shows entity type
type called account
represent a person
represent an institution
institution an institution
accounts maybe held
held by families
bank is concern
sets of characteristics
institution has characteristics
characteristics like number
number of employees
individual entity type
sets of attributes
institution and address
kind of registration
bank is concerned
kind of relationship
familiar with programming
notion of unions
case of inheritance
case of subclassing
disjoined or overlapping
individual that exist
holder an individual
track of individuals
track of institutions
set of individuals
form or participate
holder or participates
full union relationship
briefly about generalizations
generalizations and specializations
obtain the notion
notion of abstraction
abstract away unnecessary
relationship to exist
exist that means
attributes are specific
kinds of cars
activity any car
concept of higher
higher order relationships
degree of two
types that participate
shown here shows
types the supplier
part and project
entity types supplier
project and part
basically it means
reduce this ternary
relationship of degree
number of relationships
relationships of degree
supply some parts
parts maybe designated
project a supplier
supply all parts
relationships without losing
closest possible binary
simulate this ternary
stocks some parts
part is required
requires certain kinds
kinds of parts
simulating the entity
stocks certain parts
project or vice
lower order relationships
relationship called offers
taught_during certain semester
semester or instructor
semester now note
instructor has taught_during
taught_during this semester
offered_in this semester
ternary relationship implies
implies the existence
instructor i can_teach
instructor i taught_during
offered during semester
instructor has offered
semester is instructor
taught_during that semester
true the converse
reducing if instances
instances of binary
binary ration relationships
ration relationships exist
relationship also exists
exists cardinality constraints
constraints on higher
higher higher-order relationships
put cardinality constraints
constraints on higher-order
number of course-semester
instructor can teach
number of semesters
number of courses
relationship types instructor
types instructor course-semester
identify an instance
instructor may offer
offer any number
identify an instructor
notion of aggregation
aggregation this concept
concept of ontology
aggregation basically aggregates
schema and makes
level of abstraction
kind of abstraction
introduced by aggregation
introduced by inheritance
inheritance or specialization
specialization aggregation brings
concept of composition
show an aggregated
entity called offering
relationship called instructor
type called offering
offering entity type
offering contains offers
hand the relationship
relationship between generalized
generalized and specialized
specialized and generalized
classes a car
bus is-a vehicle
vehicle or monkey
offers the concept
concept of containment
covering up unnecessary
structure this offering
relationship between offering
offering and offering
number a requires
abstraction basically throws
covered the major
enhanced er notation
notation or eer
conclude the session
kinds of situations
inheritance and generalization
small university database
build a complete
kinds of typical
problems or typical
kinds of issues
basic entity types
members and staff
identified a basic
basic as entity
type called student
adding some attributes
students we note
identifies the students
university each student
attributes that characterizes
characterizes a faculty
birth and address
student and faculty
similar all ready
kind of non
non teaching staff
kinds of generalization
staff and faculty
staff and student
identify these differences
faculty and staff
categorized as employees
key called employee
identify a student
number so employee
employee and student
type called person
person entity type
faculty or staff
similarly we start
faculty heads department
identify certain kinds
kinds of association
number of faculty
member may work
member may head
head a department
number of students
students maybe registered
find some aggregations
involves particular department
department or project
project is headed
faculty member belongs
type called sponsored
sponsored project means
schema is aggregated
sponsored project entity
organization or non-governmental
foundation supports department
foundations may support
support sponsored project
department this foundation
foundation is supporting
higher-order relation relationship
faculty member collaborates
project so note
note the double
faculty entity type
project may collaborate
extends to project
member and works
session of enhanced
enhanced entity relationship
entity relationship concepts
today the first
specialization without losing
generalization is correct
is-a would hold
notion of inheritance
inherits all attributes
attributes including key
including key attributes
attributes and constraints
constraints and relationships
notion of overlapping
subclasses and disjoined
build a entity
type using union
types or categories
notion of higher-order
higher-order of relationships
reduced to lower
lower order relationship
relationship without losing
establishes the notion
notion of containment
session on enhanced
relationship concepts database

process of database
database a conceptual
design essentially means
means a high-level
meant for targeting
targeting the end
explain your database
end users today
model of data
place relational model
model with respect
answer this question
revisit our typical
process is contained
database is designed
application context databases
context that makes
analyze the universe
requirements as shown
requirements essentially meant
elements that makeup
makeup the system
elements and functionality
requirement or functional
application programming requirements
kinds of processes
requirements in turn

column is named
named as roll
named as date
date of registration
set of data
schematic data element
row is independent
row which talks
student called ananth
independent data element
related data values
relation the relation
columns roll number
registration an instance
dwell little bit
atomic data type
sessions we talked
talked about attributes
attribute a composite
non atomic attribute
person in turn
hand the age
divide this attribute
relation is defined
basically a set
set of atomic
values which defines
attribute might obtain
obtain a value
constitutes the domain
attribute called age
domains for names
names and dates
shows some examples
valid student roll
student roll numbers
cities with population
defines a space
domain a relation
definition the relational
notation a relational
schema is defined
list of attributes
case their roll
domain of roll
degree of relationship
define the degree
pretty analogies fashion
attributes roll number
set of instances
instances of relational
schema the relation
set of tuples
roll numbers times
times the set
student names times
form a relation
model ? ordering
ordering of tuples
characteristics of tuples
mathematically the relational
schema is concerned
tuples are ordered
ordered roll number
roll number wise
specifically the order
stored in sorted
order in reality
ordering of attributes
mathematics a list
order is important
important a list
set so tuple
basically a list
elements which means
values the first
first value corresponds
corresponds to roll
ordering is important
speaking in fact
roll number value
values of tuples
value that makes
tuple is assumed
atomic in nature
first normal form
normal form assumption
assumption in fact
optimized for enhanced
maintenance ? easy
addition of data
searching for data
updation of data
primarily the reason
nature and atomic
value which lies
valid roll number
roll numbers range
domain constraint specification
specification basically states
subset of attributes
tuples such kinds
identify every tuple
date of joining
roll number forms
forms a superkey
superkey because roll
attribute whose value
value is unique
combine roll numbers
number is unique
unique roll number
fact the entire
record which brings
model each tuple
tuple is distinct
distinct that means
case the entire
superkey the relation
multi multiple tuples
bag of tuples
model a key
defined a key
distinguish one tuple
identify each tuple
number is sufficient
sufficient to identify
shows the talks
student table roll
table roll number
minimal super key
door and key
door any relational
identify an employee
set of subset
uniquely identify tuples
records or salary
number now whichever
whichever candidate key
purpose of retrieval
retrieval in quires
quires and insertions
good primary key
constraints as part
constraints that make
entity integrity constraint
change of nomenclature
referential integrity constraint
relation may point
department is headed
head this department
make a reference
tuple that means
appoint some employee
employee already exist
attributes is set
hold the first
attribute in foreign
write an employee
person who heads
relation like department
manager who exists
null that means
two should hold
constraint to hold
fashion as shown
two different schemes
schemes or relational
schema has employee
works_in and reports_to
reports_to so employee
key which refers
relation so note
note that foreign
referential integrity constraints
integrity constraints hold
reporting to employee
kind of constraint
semantic integrity constraint
constraint an semantic
semantic integrity constraints
application specific constraints
checked and verified
constraints are maintained
basic relational algebra
relational algebra operations
operations that make
essentially the operations
operations of relational
operations namely retrieval
data or updates
insert and delete
operations and retrieval
operations are handled
two basic operations
operations called select
select is denoted
sigma as shown
operation the select
select a set
relation so remember
remember a relation
tuples and schema
operation to select
select a subset
select salary greater
shows here sigma
sigma salary greater
subscript and employee
parameter this operation
select the set
salary is greater
form of select
select is shown
select condition relation
slightly formal grammar
expression over attributes
equal to male
male from employee
basically says give
relation whose salary
operation is unary
unary in nature
operand the select
select operator operates
giving the select
criteria the condition
separately the condition
apply this condition
relation is independent
relation that emerges
select operation note
relation and return
number of tuples
operator is bounded
select output relation
select input relation
last properties shows
shows that select
select is commutative
interesting and important
based on condition
operator is commutative
apply the conditions
operator now select
return entire tuples
modify the schema
select over columns
select over rows
rows and return
scheme in order
operator as shown
first the command
command called project
salary from employee
table as part
projected the employee
set of list
list of operation
list and relation
give a list
project operator returns
operator returns relation
returned as part
identification or employee
start forming duplicates
project operations remove
operations remove duplicates
returned by project
relation the answer
duplicates that exist
duplicates are removed
tuples that forms
forms the database
list of project
includes the superkey
first two points
salary after projecting
mentioned this point
point in passing
select and project
relational operator select
relation the select
select operators return
return a relation
returns a relation
database that means
put a project
operator also expects
expects a relation
operators so relational
composed as shown
operator called select
operator is operating
operator is performed
fact it exist
select operator finishes
out a relation
field is greater
dynamically created forms
forms the input
relation called salary
salary statement equal
equal to project
project and select
select operators expect
queries that span
relation or employee
question that spans
project operators require
combine to form
operator to make
join in fact
ways of combining
set and combine
case of relations
relation and combine
lab now student

two different attributes
two different relations
cartesian join operator
properties of project
cartesian join represents
joins every relation
joined every student
human being read
lab that record
record is joined
student is doing
tuples that exist
relations that make
inefficient for joining
form of join
relation to form
theta join operator
relational algebra constructs
oriented towards optimized
meant for human
kind of formalism
build sound software
software so comprises
comprises of operators
elegantly take relations
relations as input
input and produce
relations as output
start combining relations
forms of combining
terms of space
required to compute
compute these joins
end of today
session database management
exploring relational algebra
depth we started
started with relational
definition that relational
learned about relational
algebra is based
represents a mapping
essentially one relation
domains that relates
relates each element
names being related
assignments between students
students and roll
underpinnings or mathematical
model is based
database an internal
schema is meant
meant or optimized
optimized towards machine
optimized towards efficient
retrieval and queries
set of relations
valid student names
similarly the set
age attributes belongs
employee or student
schema which describes
attributes that makes
attributes that make
relation is dereferenced
element that conforms
constitutes a tuple
record about student
student is independent
combination of tuples
tuples plus schema
tuples that conform
relational algebra expressions
expressions like select
properties of relations
order there relation
pure relational model
tuple which means
tuple is unique
made a statement
default the entire
entire tuples forms
forms the super
things would change
duplicates to exist
model is defined
defined a super
identify a tuple
defined a minimal
sets of minimal
minimal super keys
looked at entity
key is null
null because null
basic retrieval operators
retrieval operators select
project operators represented
greek letter sigma
operator which selects
selects a subset
subset of tuples
relation without changing
changing the schema
project operator selects
changing the data
change the number
mandate the fact
case the number
operators require specific
require specific relation
relation has input
input and provide
relation as output
answer a query
define the cartesian
product over relations
relations ? remember
product over sets
product a times
product for relations
combination of set
compute m times
tuples to generate

operations on involving
move on today
forms of join
operators which generate
generate for lesser
join the first
first join operator
join operator shows
shows a join
cartesian product symbol
two parallel lines
subscript called theta
theta join combines
relations or combines
combines the tuples
shows a specific
yesterday the student
relation is computed
student relation theta
relation theta join
theta join lab
join between student
four different tuples
operator initially generated
tuples as input
join operator starts
condition that student
prerequisite for computing
computing the join
tuples where student
shown in pink
tuples that match
match this condition
generated as input
theta join computed
efficient to compute
compute this theta
operator if lab
key of lab
integrity is maintained
compute the equality
attribute and search
key and lab
key this search
indexing or hashing
compute the join
theta join relation
relation is shown
simply two relations
subscript join conditions
simply a logical
necessarily be equality
cases the join
cases those tuples
equal to condition
theta join operators
equijoin and theta
kind of equijoin
join is denoted
denoted by star
star as shown
relation be modified
relation has attributes
attributes name roll
modified the lab
relation as lab
lab name faculty
lab name attribute
student star lab
lab which denotes
denotes a natural
attributes of student
attributes of lab
attribute here lab
attribute between student
common attributes match
condition is assumed
condition is operated
join simply takes
simply takes attribute
takes attribute names
computes an equijoin
suppose we modify
formalize this notion
notion of modification
introduce a notion
notion into relational
relation is modified
input and output
output of select
assign the attribute
shows the idea
expression here projects
takes the student
projects roll number
number and lab
roll number attribute
attribute name replaced
replaced by lab
kind of renaming
greek symbol row
expression here shows
computes a rename
rename operator work
work in general
general the rename
rename operator shows
kind of rename
subscript s operated
operated upon relation
case where row
attributes are renamed
set of operators
set theoretic operators
operators here operate
operate on relations
talking about joins
set theoretic operations
operations like unions
set theoretic operation
meant by compatible
compute a union
operators may make
define the notion
notion of compatibility
compatibility or union
definition is shown
firstly the number
span the set
valid roll numbers
operators roll number
number in relation
compute the set
operations like union
intersection and set
difference now assuming
compute set theoretic
set theoretic expressions
operator r union
returns the set
tuples are compared
tuples that lie
similarly the intersection
intersection operator returns
operator on sets
set difference operator
operator r minus
minus s returns
returns a set
properties of set
union and intersection
intersection are commutative
commutative r union
union s equal
intersection s equal
relax the fact
operator the division
slightly unintuitive operator
bit of explanation
explanation to understand
identify data elements
data elements occur
explanation of division
shows two relations
firstly the division
return the attribute
attributes b contained
values of attribute
employee has worked
employee named arun
projects that arun
arun has worked
project that arun
divides the first
first relation based
additional relational operators
two such operators
outer union operator
notion of join
recall that join
join operator takes
takes a join
input now suppose
attributes which match
condition is null
attributes are null
sake of simplicity
defined a natural
joint should point
two possible scenarios
left outer join
suppose the attributes
participating in join
join the attributes
join are null
null the left
outer join includes
includes such tuples
similarly the right
right outer join
join includes tuples
includes that part
include every tuples
operator or inclusive
inclusive join operator
lines of outer
define outer union
union or intersection
define as compatibility
basically a relaxation
union operator computes
computes the union
similarly the outer
simply some kind
inclusive union operator
operator that includes
tuples or works
works on relations
express one operators
set of relational
kind of relational
giving two examples
taking each operator
minus s union
union s minus
operation to prove
prove this equality
express the intersection
intersection using union
union and set
difference similarly joins
condition over cartesian
equivalent to select
making one generalization
relax particular constraint
constraint on relational
multi-sets and return
existence of duplicate
duplicate or duplicate
relations now first
sets where elements
elements can occur
multi-set so bag
element can occur
querying the database
database to compute
compute the average
average marks obtained
project this attributes
attributes saying project
project marks based
based on student
student now based
mark by computing
computing the sum
marks and divided
number of entries
case if duplicates
change the multi-set
duplicates and make
computing aggregate relations
relations like sum
sum and average
multi-sets or duplicates
evaluating relational expressions
things much faster
return the output
spend considerable amounts
projects and unions
unions duplicate removal
operations and union
embedded somewhere deep
project and union
desirable to tolerate
multi-sets as part
relation as part
generalization from sets
sets to multi-sets
multi-sets affect relational
affect relational operator
tuple t occur
occur n number
number of times
occur m number
define set-theoretic operations
set-theoretic operations based
union of bags
union of sets
compute the intersection
intersection of bags
tuples that occur
occur multiple times
occurs n number
times it appears
difference between bags
tuple t occurs
occurs n minus
minus m times
nt appear negative
times so tuple
number the number
canceling out tuples
out ever tuple
tuple are remaining
out all tuples
operators on bags
sets or bags
operator becomes simpler
operator simply takes
takes the requested
columns or requested
similarly the cartesian
product of bags
occurs m times
occurs mn number
expressions on bags
relations are tuples
first algebraic expression
minus t union
expression is true
element that occurs
compute r union
set this tuple
right hand side
compute r minus
occur zero number
occurs zero number
expression the distributivity
distributivity over intersection
intersection and union
intersection s union
union r intersection
tuple that occurs
expression is equal
tuple is concerned
conditions over attributes
select any tuple
holds and give
select c union
taking a union
union or disjoint
bag so tolerating
operations and algebraic
expressions over bags
decide to tolerate
quiet a significant
constitutes relational algebra
queries in relational
give a small
relational algebra queries
small database schema
database schema comprising
projects and works_on
works_on so employee
relation that talks
talks about details
employees pan number
department contains department
keys are shown
location only shows
shows each department
located and project
project shows project
project is working
similarly works_on talks
number of hours
answer these queries
employees who work
answer this query
tuples that form
form the research
select dname equal
equal to research
research from department
department now compute
employees who works
compute a join
join between research
department and employee

univ authorization dean
creates a schema
schema called univ
talking about security
security and authorization
authorization in databases
users of database
authorizations which authorizes
data manipulation operations
kinds of authorization
typically include adding
adding a table
deleting a table
adding rows deleting
kind of activities

adding or deleting
deleting data elements
modifying the table
simply a definition
alter table company
table company dot
company dot employee
dot employee add
employee add job
add job varchar
job and domain
characters now suppose
suppose the table
created a table
added certain data
suddenly i give
give an alter
column like job
value should job

operation in sql
frequently used operation
operation for retrieval
add or modify
variety of forms
basic retrieval operation
operation in relational
reemphasis the point
point that sql
based on tuple
operation of sql
sql can perform
perform both select
defined in relational
select one major
difference between sql
default relational algebra
relational algebra expects
algebra expects relation
conditions with sets
hold for bags
bags but sql
sql by default
default considers tables
operation is shown
select attribute list
list from table
shows here select
select employee number
attributes emp number
table where reports
reports to equal
means that show
numbers and names
employees who reports
manager whose employee
act on multiple
show that select
select can act
shows the definition
definition of department
create table department
address and head
heads the department
retrace the fact
fact that head
key that refers
refers to employee
heads the supply
query here requires
heads the supplies
department is supplies
small sql statement
select employee dot
department where employee
employee number equal
equal to head
head and department
department name equal
equal to supplies
similar to performing
performing a relational
relational algebra select
two tables employee
stipulating the fact
fact that employee
number of record
order to disambiguate
condition where department
dot name equal
matched against supplies
attributes by prepending
arvind kulkarni reports
suppose we write
write a query
disambiguate attribute names
names by putting
putting the table
employee where employee
equal to arvind
kulkarni and employee
employee dot reports
equal to employee
employee dot emp
dot emp number
quiet a bit
first employee table
disambiguate this attributes
aliasing so aliasing
employee as boss
select boss dot
employee and employee
first table employee
alias called boss
kulkarni and boss
boss employee number
reports to number
equal to boss
boss dot employee
dot employee number
suppose we omit
give a query
number from employee
statement is similar
returns all rows
table called employee
columns as output
combinations of employee
computed a cartesian
product between employee
select all columns
tuples and based
term called star
star from employee
equal to bhadriah
essentially this query
query is similar
relational algebra expression
select or sigma
sigma name equal
bhadriah from employee
means the entire
attributes of relations
computes the complete
complete cartesian product
tables are treated
treated in sql
sql in relational
relations or tables
tables are considered
hand in sql
multi-sets or bags
values are tolerated
expensive to remove
suppose i return
return a query
hundreds of duplicates
set of records
reorder the records
user has asked
unnecessary over head
head to remove
cases to tolerate
retain the duplicates
duplicates all contribute
number of marks
number of occurrences
occurrences to find
out the average
computing any aggregate
give the clause
clause called distinct
distinct as part
perform several set
difference using sql
sql so union
union is operated
clause called union
clause called intersection
multi-sets so note
employee where salary
lakhs union select
union select distinct
selecting the set
lakh and combining
union operator assumes
assumes that duplicates
perform a disjoint
disjoint intersection remember
data item occurs
item occurs multiple
occurs multiple times
occur the minimum
working on bags
difference or set
comparisons over character
attributes especially string
attributes by comparing
comparing partial strings
strings or comparing
comparing wild cards
two such examples
examples says select
percent so note
firstly the key
percent symbol matches
matches any number
number of characters
query here matches
characters and succeeded
underscore arun underscore
arun underscore underscore
character before arun
characters after arun
kind of character
operators like addition
multiplication and division
salary plus perks
perks not greater
shows a query
figures of employees
multiplying existing values
values of salary
create a schema
schema using sql
collection of tables
key which identifies
schemas and table
constructs or table
drop all foreign
foreign key references
drop this column
foreign key reference
key reference coming
notation of cascade
widely used operation
forms of select
features of select
nest select operators
nested select operators
widely used sql
operator or sql
number of forms
select operator treats
operator treats tables
tables as bags
shows the summary
sql standard tables
attributes and values
schemata are created
created and tables
created and constraints
essentially the select
forms that brings
explorations of databases
started out exploring
exploring the default
language or sql
continue with sql
kinds of queries
express within simple
simple sql statements
terms of sql
blocks of sql
sql namely tables
schema in sql
kinds of column
frequently used sql
operation for retrieving

today s talk
two example tables
tables in order
order to illustrate
illustrate several features
features of sql
table contains employee
key called pan
unique and non
null and employee
number which refers
dnumber which shows
table as shown
key the field
field called department
number or dnumber
relation that means
key which points
employee who heads
key is dnumber
dnumber and head
key which references
references employee number
star and slashes
slashes to perform
perform arithmetic operations
operations namely addition
form select star
returns all employee
employee records select
records select star
operator but star
star here refers
selects the entire
set of columns
sort the output
parameters the sorting
sorting is achieved
construct called order
construct is shown
shows another small
lakhs and order
employees whose salary
orders those tuples
tuples using employee
aspect of sql
queries from small
nested query note
statement the output
query to perform
perform further searches
two different parts
sake of convenience
two different colors
white and yellow
select the names
names of departments
departments where dnumber
stands for set
department number belongs
shown in yellow
query called select
dnumber from employee
analyze this query
query says select
select department numbers
departments which pays
continue with nested
queries and note
two different queries
returns a complete
relation or returns
table as sets
previous slide performed
considered the table
query as set
performed a test
test for set
outer query belongs
employee where supervisor
analyze the query
employees who report
employees where salary
returns the names
employees whose salaries
disambiguation of attribute
nested query applies
aliasing employee table
employee where e.name
employee the outer
outer query calls
number to occur
query essentially returns

queries the kind
kind of query
alias is defined
correlated nested queries
nested query occurs
analyze the behavior
nested query begins
query is performed
condition is performed
outer query assume
statement says select
select some attribute
tuples in employee
case the nested
set membership function
condition is checked
tuple that forms
forms the employee
employee number occurs
ids of people
remember this fact
fact that select
easy to understand
understand nested queries
kind of recursive
keyword called exists
exists to check
query is empty
empty then exists
exists returns true
exists some results
output is empty
empty then exist
exist returns false
employee where reportsto
equal to d.employee
head that means
heads of departments
implicitly defined sets
looked at set
checked for empty
parenthesize and enumerate
enumerate all elements
reportsto attribute holds
check for null
command called null
keyword called null
null so remember
remember what constitutes
constitutes a null
attribute a null

field bharath kumar
bharath kumar stands
stands for date
tuple in line
attributes are matched
matched so inserts
inserts an entire
entire employee record
select into employee
address and dnumber
dnumber values arun
arun k ysehwanthpur
address and department
number or dno
inserting a tuple
out any attribute
value during insertion
insert or insertion
note that select
select actually returns
returns a table
return and table
select operation returns
create a table
table called emd
manager and dno
give an insert
insert into emd
give the select
select e.employee number
dnumber as dno
set of employee
number and department
summarize the insert
remember that tables
sets therefore insert
inserts the tuple
violate any unique
give a set
tuple and give
insert also fails
insert multiple tuples
fails if referential
integrity is violated
insert an employee
number as manager
referential integrity fails
integrity fails multiple
fails multiple tuples
single insert command
giving multiple tuples
separated by commas
tuple is enclosed
enclosed within parenthesis
deletion of tuples
table ? deletion
delete from employee
deletes one tuple
note that employee
tuple says delete
employee where department
remove the condition
deletes all tuples
note that deleting
deleting all tuples
dropping the table

constraints & triggers
database managements systems
bit of ground
explorations of dbms
looked into logical
models of data
looked at physical
requirements of data
kinds of physical
physical data storage
strategies for databases
search and retrieve
taking about databases
collection of data
world wide web
tuples or relation
relation of tuples
collection of tuples
collection a bag
bag of tuple
simply a collection
kinds of tuple

constraints and referential
duplicates in tuples
forbids any tuple
constraints like key
define a tuple
default the set
form its super
concept of constraints
concept of triggers
triggers in database
database systems triggers
triggers are concepts
active database systems
typical database management
define the term
term integrity constraints
term implies integrity
implies integrity constraints
constraints are constraints
constraints that strive
strive to enforce
enforce the integrity
system of data
elements essentially states
set or validity
validity simply states
kind of correctness
application really considers
considers semantically correct
student can range
attribute called mark
pertains to validity
enter a value
field the student
valid value integrity
value integrity constraints
dbms are independent
data elements stored
form of key
form of constraints
revisit key constraints
sake of completeness
constraints a key
form of relational
manages entity existence
meant by entity
existence ? entity
existence essentially means
identify each entity
rest of tuples
relation forbids duplicate
forbids duplicate tuples
constraints therefore states
states that key
identify a subset
attribute is concerned
concerned the entity
entity constraint stipulates
verses a null
field all null
primary key relation
kind of key
constraint the referential
foreign keys remember
attributes or subset
relation a foreign
referential key integrity
key integrity constraint
integrity constraint states
assign a manger
assign a manager
set foreign key
key as null
constraint is concerned
constraints using sql
session on sql
note the creation
table in sql
shows a table
two key constraints
constraints called non-null
non-null and unique
field called reportsto
reportsto which states
references another employee
tuple and references
references the field
references the attribute
tuple in employee
constraints are identified
identified the first
first circle shows
stipulate that pan
states that employee
deference every tuple
finally we identify
identify foreign keys
foreign key constructs
references the relation
constraints be enforced
aspects of data
storage or data
inside the dbms
constrains or key
enforced a simple
create an index
field that form
form the keys
create any kind
declared primary key
primary key attribute
enforce the unique
unique constraint note
note that primary
structure to verify
value already exist
exists then inserting
violate the uniqueness
secondary key attributes
maintain secondary indexes
key actually exist
insert a tuple
tuple in fact
fact really exists
enforcing referential integrity
referential integrity sql
sql automatically rejects
rejection is performed
option for managing
alterations or updates
updates in tables
tuple is deleted
tuple is asked
deleted then sql
table called manager
referencing this tuple
referencing the department
department is deleted
deleted similarly sql
similarly sql rejects
rejects any updates
part to tuples
affect the foreign
update the department
rejects this update
table and change
change the department
violates some foreign
makes some foreign
foreign keys dangling
dangling then sql
sql would reject
updates and deletes
force the dbms
maintained however updates
deletes are cascaded
constructs in sql
sql that instructs
instructs the dbms
dbms to perform
fashion than mere
cascade a cascade
reference tuple make
change my department
change all referencing
referencing to department
instruct the dbms
set null option
creates a table
key called reportsto
key references employee
references employee relation
employee number field
foreign key relation
foreign key specification
two other constructs
constructs the first
delete set null
essentially it means
deleted then set
set this field
null without violating
violating referential integrity
employees then set
set the field
field as null
manager with employee
number is changed
make corresponding modifications
sql also supports
deferred constraint checks
checks a deferred
deferred constraint check
tells the dbms
tuple that don
make a constraint
require a deferred
checks ? deferred
deferred constraints checks
constraints or circular
circular referential integrity
shows two tables
integrity the table
table essentially states
manager the department
relation the department
field called manager
upgraded its database
porting the set
adding these tuples
adding a set
difficult to guarantee
adding a department
manager already exist
adding a manager
impossible to sustain
sustain or maintain
deferred integrity check

option essentially defers
essentially defers integrity
defers integrity constraints
encounter a situation
maintained the integrity
employee number attribute
separately specify foreign
department id references
deferred that means
deferrable essentially means
integrity is deferred
initially deferred means
means explicitly tells
tuple is tuple
tuple of type
manager is inserted
defer the referential
referential integrity checks
constraints from key
constraints on attributes
states that null
checks against duplicate
attribute being inserted
form of attribute
constraints in sql
kind of attribute
first example defines
defines a field
attribute called gender
single character char
imposes an integrity
two valid characters
assigned for gender
shows a field
field called age
check that states
states that check
check that age
age is greater
talking about employee

foundation for concurrency
basics of transaction
transaction processing systems
system we looked
transactions in database
essential for programs
property is required
required to ensure
executed the property
database is maintained
malign the values
database the property
transaction the property
transaction is returned
returned its value
property is realized
realized in database
mechanisms in database
concepts of transactions
view of concurrency
call as foundations
control in databases
foundations for concurrency
databases by first
introducing the notion
basically the basic
notion of ensuring
consistency in databases
produced after understanding
systems that ensure
database are serializable
understand the meaning
schedule in database
database transaction system
write a series
first the notion
write the actual
essentially the database
operation which means
read an item
read x shows
operations that means
means the value
write x write
means that write
back to database
two extra operations
transaction execution commit
execution commit means
operations a transaction
transaction can issue
commit actually means
means essentially discard
typically the transaction
store the values
database or discard
database a schedule
schedule essentially consists
consists of read
define the schedule
taking a set
system where passengers
book their ticket
travel to delhi
delhi by rajdhani
book his ticket
chennai to delhi
operations simultaneously operating
leaving the database
berth to travel
travel from chennai
produce consistent results
reads the current
current reservation information
abbreviate as read
give an prefix
done by transaction
rajdhani express availability
cases the passenger
state after reading
reading the availability
booking the final
reasons the passenger
cases the transaction
transaction after started
started could abort
abort the operation
operation of writing
writing this values
system which means
essentially the passenger
interested in booking
booking the berth
basically transaction commits
writing this value
basically another transaction
database from transaction
transactions are coming
executing the read
write operations relating
aborting the transactions
operations are performed
leaves the database
sequence of instructions
execution so read
read x read
resulted in reading
result in reading
resulted whatever computations
done and writing
write a value
commits which means
notice the effect
transaction are last
transaction also read
writing the values
characterize this consistency
characterize the schedules
schedules in terms
database this requires
executed from start
start to finish
consistent from start
start to end
thing is true
end is executed
schedule a serial
finishing the earlier
produces a serial
producing correct results
booking for rajdhani
book the reservation
problem in terms
affect the database
enforcing a serial
first important concept
schedule and produce
produce a serial
serial equivalence schedule
schedule but equivalent
notion of equivalent
schedule two schedules
schedules are equivalent
operations will define
point to define
define equivalent schedule
kind of equivalence
call as conflict
conflict serial ability
transactions are conflicting
operations and ensure
operations are done
operations in transactions
transactions conflict conflicting
conflict conflicting operations
essentially a write
give this notion
serializability that means
means you don
means when operations
performed this operations
operation is performed
two y occurred
order this transactions
two operation occur
longer can infer
obeying conflict serializability
give the notion
schedules which means
set of operation
fashion on schedule
two conflicting orders
two are equivalent
transaction one reads
change the order
order of non-conflicting
two as shown
read of transaction
write of transaction
two are conflicting
conflict equivalent conflict
conflict it terms
terms of equivalence
terms of conflicting
introduce the notion
deciphering whether schedules
schedules are schedules
produce serial schedule
consistent the simple
execute all operations
doing is consistent
change the operations
transform a schedule
schedule in terms
executed this conflicting
basically a serializable
producing the serializable
schedule because serializable
reduced by swapping
swapping the non-conflicting
effect conflict serializable
conflict serializable schedules
schedule is conflict
serializability is concerned
transactions produce serializable
produce serializable schedules
notion of serializability
transactions to produce
produce consistent schedules
database is operating
passengers keep coming
reserving the tickets
set of schedules
operation of transaction
database is concerned
transactions keep coming
close the transaction
close the schedule
put a break
schedule which means
committed or aborted
schedule is concerned
concerned whose operations
transactions that means
means the complete
projection of schedule
apply the notion
apply the equivalence
equivalence this schedule
schedule a simple
algorithm which constructs
constructs a graph
system now assume
operations on data
appears the operation
provide arc showing
operation is concerned
conflict is concerned
relationship in terms
terms of conflict
essentially a cycle
graph which means
graph of forming
forming a cycle
cycle ? assume
arc is concerned
executed the last
done to show
cycle it shows
schedule the presence
graph is shown
shown to produce
produce non serializable
transactions are put
concept is concerned
graph to understand
basically produces serial
produces serial schedule
executing the transactions
essentially these protocols
construct the transaction
transaction is put
sequence is concerned
produce a cycle
current transaction graph
avoid a cycle
cycle from coming
graph to grow
direction it prevents
prevents any cycle
cycle from occurring
put a backward
protocol to decide
decide to put
made to read
essentially the concept
graph is constructed
cycle is prevented
prevented from happening
kinds of consistency
requirements an interesting
thing to understand
consistency is concerned
basically t1 executing
thing to happen
number of debits
debits and credits
unit and credit
execute is consistent
understanding the semantics
right or wrong
database transaction execution
execution is concerned
add some numbers
means i credit
add some number
consistent with respect
read is happening
transaction in terms
produced the value
relationship is maintained
maintained between transactions
equivalent in terms
appose to actual
actual conflict serializability
equivalence of schedules
equivalent as appose
appose to conflict
conflict operations equivalent
operations equivalent schedules
view equivalent schedules
operations are related
produced and read
order is changed
equivalent the final
final write operations
producing consistent results
considered as debit
produce correct results
results as appose
correctness by understanding
semantics of operations
show how semantics
applied for understanding
understanding the consistency
queue as shown
condition when adds
adds and deletes
deletes are happening
basically an add
delete will happen
suddenly be concurrent
deletes can occur
concurrently because add
manipulate the rear
manipulating the front
semantics of add
add and delete
knowing the semantics
two produce consistent
mechanism for producing
two adds working
lock the rear
pointer and ensure
means the access
access to rear
parallely or concurrently
understanding the operation
transaction and applying
call as semantic
semantic actually means
apply the meaning
operation to decide
level of consistency
criterions by understanding
understanding the meaning
covered the idea
basically a schedule
produced equivalence schedules
aspects two schedules
schedules are shown
conflict operation point
order is maintained
showed view equivalence
schedule the writes
occur on operations
schedules we call
view equivalent schedule
semantics and based
based on semantics
commute the commutative
producing consistent schedules
case of conflict
achieved by constructing
constructing a transaction
graph a transaction
constructed by producing
serializability is achieved
constructing the transaction
designed to produce
produce the serializable
schedule the criterion
produce conflict serializability
discuss a series
series of protocols
set of protocols
protocols we start
locking and show
locking will produce
show other kinds
kinds of protocols
protocols that exploit
exploit the property
graph is concerned
exploit this property
construct the cycle
essentially can divide
divide the protocols
optimistic or pessimistic
constructed for producing
producing serializable schedules
book by burnstien
basically a book
book on concurrency
basic the foundation
book on fundamentals
fundamentals of database
systems by elmasri
elmasri and sham
book while doing
foundations on concurrency
doing the protocols
control  part
problem of serializability
serializability when transactions
theory for correct
reduced to serializable
meant by conflict
forms of serializability
serializability like view
specific concurrency control
types of algorithms
execution of transactions
serializable that means
means which produce
produce correct execution
concurrency control algorithms
two broad classes
control algorithms based

transactions so locking
explain the concepts
concepts of locking
familiar in operating
mutual exclusion problem
section the critical
piece of code
address a share
share data structure
shared data structure
manipulate the share
section for manipulating
basically the read
read write operations
sense the mutual
understand in operating
essentially a lock
lock the critical
unlock the critical
acquires this lock
operating system context
case of databases
mutually exclusion problem
types of locks
introduce read lock
read the data
important that means
write lock means
data item transaction
number of transactions
transactions can start
reading the item
means there won
transaction can write
abbreviate write lock
lock that means
means this lock
distinguishing the kind
kind of locks
increase the concurrency
acquires a read
acquire this lock
extra write lock
work was finished
words as opposed
distinguish the semantics
optimize the concurrency
understand the granularity
algorithms the granularity
granularity actually means
transaction only locks
locks a simple
simple data item
table one single
single data item
student getting locked
database the entire
locked that means
important to understand
transactions only locks
locks that small
increasing the granularity
granularity it starts
locking a large
number of items
increase a granularity
reduce the concurrency
system for transactions
execute one simple
out the lock
reduces the number
access is controlled
room at aty
aty given point
room is locked
amount of concurrency
suddenly should lock
lock as small
keeping the consistent
criteria into account
simple two phase
phase locking protocol
term two phase
phase locking explains
algorithm the first
release the locks
execution in terms
reach execution points
accessing bank card
bank card database
acquire a read
balance data item
lock the entire
reached a point
granted the lock
basically the growing
phase the growing
move some items
form one room
step before moving
moving the items
room or manipulating
manipulating the items
basically start releasing
releasing the locks
transaction is released
released one lock
condition that enforces
transaction has reached
reached this point
two phase protocol
phase protocol works
transaction and understand
consequences of applying
transaction and show
reading an item

acquire or read
write an item
work of reading
reading a data
writing a data
release this lock
release the lock
released the lock
hold the lock
transaction t1 start
locking will ensure
acquired a lock
two conflicting transactions
acquired the lock
protocol will work
meaning of acquiring
acquiring a lock
achieved as part
show a small
proof to show
locking in effect
effect produces serializable
produces serializable order
order of transactions
locking in terms
item is locked
problem of dead
lock on data
requesting a lock
reach the point
point of lock
transactions can reach
reach their point
reach the lock
release these locks
release a lock
make the system
transactions to wait
locks the dead
basically bring bring
bring the system
drastically which means
number of transaction
drastically get affected
dead lock condition
lock condition problems
problems of deadlocks
occurs and make
release their locks
transaction can proceed
break the dead
aborted to make
proceed so deadlocks
deadlocks needs detection
resolving this deadlock
system can proceed
algorithm two phase
algorithm also doesn
produce optimal schedules
phase locking ensures
transaction always proceeds
grants a lock
aborts the transaction
case of optimistic
proceed to execute
resolve the deadlocks
deadlocks by resolve
resolve the conflicts
sense optimal schedules

sit and view
view your movie
movie in effect
basically high conflict
high conflict data
conflict data items
viewed the data
modify or manipulate
manipulate a small
percentage of data
requires some kind
kind of concurrency
apply a pessimistic
algorithm which ensures
consistent way works
ultimately a single
ticket which means
abort after proceeding
information they abort
pessimistic concurrency control
beginning which means
manipulate the data
difference between optimistic
sense and understand
consistency is enforced
transactions are concerned
graph and start
cases of optimistic
control the idea
terms of resolving
resolving the conflicts
transaction an incoming
proceeded to execute
sense or makes
satisfies the consistency
follow the diagram
diagram to understand
disturb the order
things are happening
conflicting data items
force the relationship
insert this relationship
sequence of actions
violates the consistency
consistency which means
ate my evening
suddenly my dinner
relation is correct
future relations doesn
violate whatever order
write this relationship
break the cycle
introduces the inconsistency
essentially this cycle
produce consistent execution
transactions now understand
solve this problem
versus how optimistic
optimistic concurrency control
graph to illustrate
graph is fixed
algorithm which means
executing this condition
makes t4 execution
execute which means
basically not allowing
disallow the transaction
allowed to execute
talking this spectrum
execute and stop
violating the restriction
deeper and understand
disallow the transactions
transactions from executing
executing from beginning
produces serializable schedules
set of conflicting
ultimately a transaction
transaction transaction boils
operations this transaction
make this order
complete the notation
operation being performed
operation of first
xth data item
manipulating data item
acquire a lock
simultaneously to understand
case of banking
simultaneously withdrawing cash
account the minute
withdraw the amount
simultaneously can view
producing any inconsistent
withdrawing which means
operations being conflicting
operations have executed
happen with respect
relation is important
account is concerned
interested in finding
out the relationship
relation essentially boils
executed with respect
o1j and operation
write this order
producing inconsistent results
understand which operation
series of execution
drop the actual
actual operation suffix
order which means
transactions which means
produces the inconsistent
operation is defined
lock was obtained
lock on jet
obtained this sequence
lock was granted
obtained a lock
relationship is impossible
relation as shown
fit into regular
requires a lock
set of equations
released this lock
released a lock
lock i won
release that lock
remember the condition
locks are obtained
release the previous
meant by lock
lock point right
finishes the execution
release one lock
asked for lock
means that transaction
lock a lock
supposed to execute
essentially the reason
condition is put
problem the cycle
prevents the cycle

makes you understand
transaction is start
start to executing
ensures the consistency
transaction is inconsistent

produce a value
produces the inconsistency
submit their values
execute and produce
produce this values
give the values
violating the property
essentially the cycle
check this dependency
produced inconsistent results
restart the execution
database and start
pure pessimistic kind
submitted my value
basically a loss
loss of execution
day t4 didn
kind of algorithm
asked to read
executing the transaction
sense the pure
allowed this scenario
aborts are required
optimistic let things
thing you check
transactions generally operate
items that means
completely disjoint sets
overhead is reduced
end of validation
pass the validation
apply a optimistic
purely pessimistic scenario
conflictive which means
thing data item

serializes the transaction
concept this notion
transaction is split
split into sub
transactions and execute
execute on multiple
single time stamp
multiple time zones
problem of making

stamp this timestamp
subsequently for checking
transactions are tagged
stamp read operations
operations and write
operations the transactions
transactions at tagged

forget the entire
entire earlier history
set the counter
giving time stamp
basically a logical
logical time stamp
two is higher
decide in terms

leave the iit
put a band
leave the system
basically know abort

supposed to leave
leave this system
system by twelve
twelve o clock
stamp which means
means that ending
transaction dint finish
algorithms to generate
extremely interesting ways
fixed a band
band a band
finish the execution
intelligently use generation
issues with respect
transaction every transaction
forgotten to mention
accept a read
accept the reads
operation is accepted
accepted the abort
rtx corresponding rtx
highest of rtx
set to rts
wtx the highest
highest of wts
wts always reflect
stamp the highest
read or written
making these counters
counters typically rts
wts are counters
counters they stored
stored the value
highest transaction value
two pl kind
apply a basic
stamping algorithm verses
verses the locking
thing as done
phase locking kind
execute then commit
execution that means
completely finishes releases
releases its lock
thing that happen
applied the locking
item which means
released that means
basically start executing
shifted the execution
apply time stamping
stamping based algorithm
case where transaction
lower than transaction
stamp on data
attempting accessing data
accessing data item
access data item
accessed by transaction
earlier to recollect
finished with accessing
reaches this point
basically the lock
reaches the lock
cases more concurrency
locking but remember
straightly a optimistic
transaction should execute
transaction time stamps
fully optimistic scenario
sort of committing
validation and make
make that transaction
stamp to order
order these transactions

transaction that fails
validation is aborted
transactions just enter
enter the systems
required data items
transactions gets validated
transactions read sets
transaction will agree
sets and decide
conflict and based
transactions are allowed
allowed to commit

read phase irrespective
perform this check
validation is performed
write phase depending
basically the transaction

similarly in terms
terms of read
phases because based

equivalent to conflict
enforced is write
phase of write
read phase started

phases that means
means the first
phase which participations
participations are prepared
phase actual commitment
commitment take place
protocol naturally integrates
centralized database system
protocol and study
sudden things happen
means the protocol
recovery take place
words certain kind
commit actually locks
locks the protocol
blocks the system
avoid the wait
wait free protocol
failure occurs wait

failure so wait
wait free protocols
important in distributed
avoid certain kind
failures and make

protocol as opposed
protocol in detail
context of distributed
circumstances two phase
commit protocol works
protocol works correctly
mechanism as applied
distributed transaction systems
point will concentrate
explain in detail
commit protocol means
basically the begin
basically the agent
debit on node
basically the sub
credit on node
operating on account
committing my transaction
reach this point
writing or doing
doing the debit
transaction one reason
present on node
reasons which means
means that account
means the debit
case the agent
abort my part
complete my part
finish debit transactions
case is account
withdraw two hundred
account again agent
commit this transactions
cases both nodes
agree both agent
commit their transaction
protocol gets started
start this commit
protocol to ascertain
protocol to ensure
committing the transaction
fix a coordinator
executed we call
participants where call
call the sub
transactions is executed
coordinator and number
number of participants
initiate the commit
protocol and make
participants and based
decision again inform
terminate the commit
coordinator each participant
replying on behalf
things are done
initiates the commit
transaction he initiates
send certain messages
two various participants
participants and make
executing this commit
start the commit
entire prepared message
message this message
message he prepares
prepares the participants
sending the prepare
replies are received
participants not responding
coordinator basically puts
period actually starts
immediately after sending
make a decision
decision to make
participants to abort
committing or abort
out has reached
reached and replies
relating to abort
participant is concerned
participant actually decides
decides now waits
protocol that means
means to start
undecided state wait
wait for prepare
things which participant
ready message means
commit his part
message the ready
commit his transaction
successfully his part
commit his sub
sending the ready
logs are return
write the locks
replied with ready
commit this transaction
release your locks
participant should write
required locks participant

writing the locks
transactions is achieved
transaction manager ltm
manager ltm ensures
local transactions properties

message the coordinator
preparing the participants
participants for commit
participants for committing
two separate phases
reason the participant
commit his transactions
sends an abort
abort answer message
message which means
aborting his answer
answer for prepare
prepare is abort
giving an abort
commit when coordinator
receives this abort
decision so phase
coordinator enters phase
making the decision
decision on commit
out period coordinator

3-phase commit protocol
looked at basic
basic two phase
protocol just stopped
coordinator protocol working
starts with sending
sending a prepare
sends a prepare
coordinator actually receives
send the commit
coordinator will reach
abort that means
coordinator to reach
receive the message
participants is failed
abort message right
commit is concerned
message in response
give a ready
basically ready state
state now wait
acknowledge and reach
case the participant
participant actually commits
sends an acknowledgement
acknowledgement that means
explain this protocol
coordinator can fail
participant can fail
network could fail
protocol is concerned
things we looked
resilient which means
cases of failures
fails in phase
decision of aborting
aborting or sending
sending an abort
abort decision co-coordinator
co-coordinator will timeout
happen when participant
commit is resilient
resilient for participant
phase that means
participant has replied
message it means
replied the ready
decision or commit
recovery that means
recover from failure
failure after recovery
participant should check
coordinator participant checks
decision what happened
terminate the transaction
tells now coordinator
replied with replied
coordinator is feed
feed to choose
choose a decision
depending on read
commit the message
case the commit
failure the coordinator
read the decision
acknowledgement from participant
write the final
failures to happen
coordinator and participant
participant also fail
failures of participant
participant alone coordinator
phase the coordinator
coordinator has failed
case were coordinator
means he sends
messages actually arrived
reached the decision
fail the coordinator
recover is simple
restart the protocol
coordinator will send
send the prepare
transaction by running
coordinator has elected
coordinator is elected
transaction is restarted
participants are live
starts the protocol
make an abort
protocol become reentered
means any number
number fails failures
failures is occurred
coordinator will fail
algorithm to elect
coordinator actually fails
coordinator actually fail
means that decision
aborting or committing
receives the coordinator
coordinator of decision
decision live participants
live participants received
received the decision
fails some participant
receives the decision
participants has received
non-blocking that means
means that normal
normal that means
recover back right
shooting is happening
recording person decides
out for tea
blocked you wont
put in automatic
continue our job
participant to recover
failure suffer means
protocol is non-blocked
two sub cases
failure that means
means only coordinator
failed the decision
case first case
live that means
protocol by electing
coordinator and restart
commit the participant
participant also failed
failure which means
people the interesting
decision of committing
remaining participant elect
elect the leader
terminate the protocol
participants are blocked
coordinator to recover
wait for coordinator
failure also means
means a participant
started normally coordinator
coordinator normally coordinator
failure a coordinator
failure normally means
failure only thing
participant can elect
elect the coordinator
coordinator can make
participant is forced
forced to wait
protocol gets modified
protocol to recover
intuitively to understand
state it state
important distributed system
node when things
system is easy
fails you won
means the coordinator
phase of committing
observe the problem
terms of moving
moving um coordinator
prepared to commit
introduce a prepare
coordinator which means
coordinator has prepared
prepared to reach
reached to prepare
prepare commit state
protocol can tolerate
coordinator will introduce
state or prepared
send a prepare
reach the undecided
reached the state
state before commit
issue the commit
state after receiving
reasons to move
state as usual
abort acknowledgement message
coordinator state diagram
participant state diagram
reach the ready
participant will reach
state in case
state it receives
receives the abort
reach this state
reaches that state
participant will move
state to abort
ready to commit
responded ready message
enter the state
prepare to commit
reaches the prepare
transaction is waiting
final decision coordinator
state this additional
state is needed
fails after reaching
reaching the prepare
participant to elect
case after coming
back after recovery
recovery from failure
participant to move
move from prepare
commit abort state
diagram we looked
actual failure scenarios
failures can occur
occur as usual
usual participant failing
phase second phase
phase are similar
similarly the coordinator
examine this case
case in terms
recovery takes place
coordinator nobody receives
commit state prepared
committed the transaction
coordinator actually passes
coordinator has passed
means it fail
simple case coordinator
case coordinator fails
participant have received
case is easy
knowing the coordinators
introducing an extra
reach before state
failure is handled
handled by introducing
phase for commitment
coordinator is failing
failing these equivalent
leader election algorithm
electing a leader
doing a leader
signing in terms
unique id node
simple way assign
assign the highest
assign the live
failed that means
option of finding
process of finding
highest least node
make that node
node also discovers
coordinator starts running
running the recovery
number of coordinator
failures are tolerated
make a participant
run the protocol
achieved in terms
things the properties
ensure that protocol
run any number
times that means
means a coordinator
running the algorithm
protocol that coordinator
failed which means
reentrance that means
basically the protocol
tolerant to multiple
coordinator any number
ways the reenter
making it move
understand this point
carefully the coordinator
means that node
start the protocol
run the entire
entire protocol staring
imitates the prepare
receives the ready
improve the protocol
decision of earlier
protocol to terminate
coordinator now ignore
ignore this decision
conducts the sends
sends a message
enter the abort
coordinator to find
force the protocol
basically dint receive
receive the prepare
received this message
terminated the abort
receive this pcm
reached a state
message this state
commit a transaction
check its state
checks the state
live participant based
reentrant protocol terminates
direction in terms
terms of committing
protocol to commit
terms of recovery
coordinator is concerned
scenarios of failures
talking about network
failures as part
terms of network
interpreting the network
failure actually means
back bone network
network it involved
basically a network
providing this connectivity
network actually fails
node has fail
case it wont
detect the difference
node is concerned
receive the reply
failure the node
doing some work
receive the ready
means a network
sense actually translates
failure the simple
case this translates
timeout actually reads
harm is done
done positive thing
thing is ends
commit the node
message or abort
assumes then abort
failure and node
commit are resilient
resilient to network
failures in terms
terms of translating
reach to multiple
typically this scenario
failure actually results
results in multiple
node in chennai
network actually connecting
assume that complicated
kind of hub
hub that connects
connects the southern
hub actually fail
nodes can reach
direction now assume
assume that chennai
chennai is concerned
translates into failure
mumbai and delhi
results in partitioning
set of nodes
consisting of mumbai
partition two consisting
consisting of chennai
chennai and bangalore
bangalore could start
participants have failed
resilient to participant
making the transaction
right to run
run this protocol
two participants failure
delhi are concerned
failure one participant
nodes are delivering
making an distinction
distinction network failure
network actually partitions
partitions the nodes
nodes into multiple
making an assumption
case no partitioning
problem of recovering
case which discuss
taking them participant
network partitioning network
partitioning network partitioning
partitioning can lead
lead to problem
protocols the states
case the partitioning
partition and based
open ended problem
recover from network
make a distinction

system is provided
database is stored
existing file system
implications of doing
keeping one directory
directory per database
implications are shown
names of tables
sensitive or case
case insensitive depending
unix based system
linux based system
two different names
system like windows
table and tables
renamed and dropped
dropped using operating
operating system commands
move or rename
.myi and .frm
database called employees
directory called employees
employee.myi and employee.frm
employee.frm now suppose
move these files
names using operating
engines does mysql
engine that determines
determines how tables
tables are organized
organized within files
engines also differ
differ with respect
support for transaction
support atomic updates
support isolated updates
engines that mysql
primary storage engine
mysql where shift
isam storage engine
myisam storage engine
storage engine isam
isam essentially stands
stands for indexed
indexed sequential access
sequential access mode
provide any transactional
heap storage engine
tables or virtual
memory storage engine
engine called merge
merge storage engine
treat several isam
single merge table
merge different tables
engines like innodb
transaction safe updates
updates that means
means it provide
support for acid
engine was released
source code form
pre compile binaries
semantics on mysql
make a lot
lot of sense
sense to download
bdb storage engine
ndb clusters storage
clusters storage engine
single system interface
provide the combined

machines now ndb
engine that exploits
exploits this capability
recent storage engine
supported by mysql
compile this engine
forms or pre
pre compiled versions
semantics in mysql
mysql ? transaction
supported in mysql
mysql actually supported
disadvantages of atomic
updates versus acid
versus acid semantics
specific acid semantics
performing some debit
debit credit updates
kind of money
mysql which supports
supports the inno
bdb storage engines
support for full
full transaction semantics
non-transactional storage engines
updates or atomic
setting auto commit
auto commit equal
commit is automatic
query these non-transactional
non-transactional atomic updates
transactional storage engines
worry about locking
locking and isolation
isolation based semantics
worry about logging
first was locking
logging and logging
logging in order
support log based
support durability aspect
aspect of acid
updates are required
happening or suppose
non transactional storage
engines which support
support only atomic
faster than acid
support acid updates
feature of mysql
table use inno
full acid semantics
procedures ? stored
set of sql
kinds of sql
procedures as part
store sql statements
procedures and stored
functions a procedure
procedure essentially performs
performs a set
return multiple values
execution so stored
stored procedures support
phenomenon in mysql
support stored procedures
increases the performance
terms of communication
number of stored
amount of communication
server for execution
side of stored
clients are connecting
server and calling
procedures and mysql
pre compiled libraries
compiled libraries written
application specific language
procedures are created
create procedure construct
construct in sql
sql and functions
create function constructs
constructs and procedures
procedures are invoked
return one specific
value so functions
value while procedures
value in fact
fact a procedure
function is distinguished
clause so function
function says returns
returns this thing
declaring a stored
average working hours
hours per week
completely different database
invoke a stored
give an sql
statement that spans
spans over multiple
database and implicit
start using tables
statement is terminated
call stored procedure
database by prepending
employeerecords.updatesalary where updatesalary
procedure that performs
updates on salary
salary and employee
procedure is stored
fact that stored
database is dropped
procedures and functions
support for triggers
covered a session
session on constraints
constraints and triggers
essentially special kind
kind of stored
written using eca
conditions is true
true now support
comprehensive in mysql
essentially stored procedures
automatically in response
physically materialized depending
kind of application
transactional applications views
materialized mysql supports
mysql supports views
views as virtual
supported from mysql
treated as real
purposes that means
means each table
access privilege system
read privilege write
privilege write privilege
delete the table
updation is automatic
tables are supported
supported and views
views are created
created using create
create or replace
construct is present
mysql handle constraints
mysql the notion
notion of triggers
triggers or calling
calling stored procedures
procedures is separate
constraints the kinds
data specific constraints
primary key constraint
constraint or unique
essentially that primary
violation then mysql
mysql will roll
transactional storage engine
performs the transaction
update the row
updated some rows
non-transactional storage engine
insert or update
queries also support
support a keyword
keyword called ignore
means that constraint
mysql automatically inserts
inserts the default
value is null
reason that mysql
catch such violations
query parsing stage
efficient to stop
query so mysql
similarly for queries
insert invalid values
numbers or null
string for strings
enumerated data type
column called gender
column called grade

talked about mysql
source or free
firstly the oracle
version of oracle
oracle is manufactured
manufactured by oracle
oracle corporation headed
pretty early player
field of commercial
commercial database management
versions of oracle
today is oracle
stands for data
database can sense
larger data grid
grid and operate
single data source
kind of targeted
warehousing and business
business intelligence kinds
kinds of applications
talking about oracle
invented and evolved
academic and research
community for database
management systems similar
systems similar kinds
kinds of terminologies
terminologies and evolutions
evolutions have happened
class might differ
commercial database engine
makes a lot
sense to clear
kinds of terminology
engine that serves
files that form
database but oracle
considers its database
stored data including
data including log
including log files
files and control
files that make
set of processes
processes including oracle
including oracle system
oracle system processes
oracle server runs
runs and user
user processes created
operation what kinds
kinds of languages
languages does oracle
support ? oracle
supports the ansi
ansi sql standard
specific to oracle
well-known ansi sql
procedural query language
top of sql
sense a pure
pure query language
kinds of variables
variables by aliasing
generally it doesn
kinds of language
complete procedural language
define control flow
constructs and looping
embed sql statement
structure in oracle
kinds of structures
dbms the physical
physical structure refers
logical structure corresponds
database that oracle
oracle is maintaining
oracle manages data
database which comprises
larger logical structure
structure and update
rules and associations
oracle stores data
data on disk
basically stores data
files on disk
buffer management policies
policies for writing
data into files
meant by buffer
data ? dbms
dbms like mysql
taking a unix
unix based implementation
implementation or linux
linux based implementation
mysql and oracle
high level system
level system calls
calls for writing
data into disk
disk that means
means high level
level system call
operating system kernel
kernel and lets
lets the kernel
kernel take care
care of writing
writing the data
write your data
block onto disk
play or affect
affect dbms operations
talking about database
database recovery processes
suddenly a system
write has returned
committed some transaction
oracle uses low
low level system
calls that means
means oracle manages
cache and oracle
flush the buffer
write to files
file system interface
files that oracle
files are updated
updated in oracle
maintaining its databases
firstly the data
set of redo
redo log files
log files remember
redo log file
redo based recovery
first write data
flushing the log
redo based starting
maintains the set
files as part
part of database
set of control
kinds of control
addition to control
files and alert
alert logs trace
logs trace files
files that track
track certain background
processes that oracle
oracle runs oracle
oracle basically runs
runs to monitor
events and call
triggers or enable
files essentially track
track this background
files and logs
alert logs maintains
maintains a log
system the log
recovery therefore oracle
oracle also supports
write a log
parallel to multiple
devices the advantages
files from actual
devices to recover
process is increased
increased as part
logical database organization
organized in oracle
file and file
file is managed
managed by low
system call operation
kinds of objects
objects a schema
object contains definitions
definitions of tables
definitions of views
views or sequences
sequences or stored
clusters or links
serialized and stored
object orientation methodology
set of procedures
procedures or methods
methods which handles
set of services
objects and definitions
schema object represents
access or perform
perform different kinds
kinds of table
access a table
table row wise
perform any perform
perform any index
search on table
essentially the system
maintains different kinds
kinds of cataloging
information for oracle
information like user
names and security
kinds of privileges
object and information
information about schema
object then integrity
trigger certain schema
kinds of statistics
performing good query
role of cataloging
process a query

making the query
schema or logical
space a table
concept in oracle
describes the physical
physical storage structures
space is organized
manages the pages
database so earlier
earlier we mentioned
mentioned the concept
instance an oracle
entire oracle system
processes and user
comprises one instance
system global area
essentially the area
sense to give
give an analogy
analogy to operating
resources and memory
sense the kernel
database buffer cache
maintained by oracle
order to flush
control when buffers
buffers are flushed
redo log buffer
log is returned
turn is flushed
disk at periodic
processes an oracle
addition to user
program global area
area in contrast
data and control
database in addition
processes so oracle
oracle itself runs
runs several processes
background which comprises
comprises the server
processes may comprise
process is depending
single threaded server
processes like audit
trails and system
belong to oracle
out a lot
lot of things
form the oracle
area which comprises
buffer they interact

processes they interact
turn which interact
oracle server processes
processes and oracle
possibly other processes
correct this diagram
arrow is correct
logically the server
server processes deal

request from user
processes or oracle
send sql queries
kinds of ways
configure your oracle
server and dedicated
handle one client
server is concurrent
handle many client
spawning different threads
threads or processes
addition to server
instance of oracle
perform these asynchronous
processes essentially perform
delayed write operation
background processes wakes
cache onto disk
give a read
data is read
read the relevant
relevant data blocks
blocks are read
process is awakened
performance and reliability
kinds of background
roles that perform
good to distinguish
database writer process
process that writes
writes the buffer
log writer background
writer background process
process which mediates
log buffer cache
disk so data
processes are managed
log flushing process
check point background

supported message parsing
complaint in order
kind of platform
message is parsed
wrapper so soap
generalization over message
message parsing frame
parsing frame works
works in distributed
distributed object base
object base systems
extended from simple
small distributed systems
systems like corba
larger web base
web base services
analogy also exists
exists in data
integration where data
databases in preexisting
forms and preexisting
wrapping the data
assuming relational databases
correct because majority
world are relational
databases so assuming
assuming that existing
databases are relational
platforms a simple
convert relational tables
form to xml
two different columns
xml document actors
actors and slash

xml tree mapped
essentially an xml
trees like title
finally the leaf
divide this tree
tree into physical
physical data blocks
kind of division
division makes sense
dividing a tree
tree into disk
cluster trees based
based on sub
show sub tree
turn just stores
entire sub tree
user just navigates
opens an element
tree and opens
opens another element
file system navigation
kinds of navigational
user is navigating
user would open
open this sub
tree and start
read an entire
access itself suppose
suppose the user
query saying show
access every data
stores the show
element in order
order to access
answer attribute kind
answering navigational kind
kind of access
database storage structure
cluster similar elements
imdb and show
show and title
storing an entire
level are clustered
elements are clustered
red data block
single data block
blue data block
pointers that point
elements that don
cdata or pcdata
sense the dual
efficient for answering
answering attribute queries
elements or return
return all show
term the fugitive
access this block
element and find
find a pointer
data block access
lesser data blocks
access all title
store so answering
answering an attribute
answering a navigational
query becomes difficult
clustered if clustering
clustering is performed
lowest level elements
difficult to navigate
open a title
title to year
year it requires
based on paths
based on single
clustering similar elements
techniques cluster similar
cluster similar paths
cluster all paths
form imdb show
show and year
universally most efficient
accessing or storing
storing xml databases
extent it depends
cluster the tree
store sub trees
trees within data
full text searches
sense to cluster
problem of indexing
indexing xml documents
indexing requirements arise
arise for xml
addition to attribute
attribute value indexing
traditional rdbms indexing
two other kinds
termed as full
search on free
free text data
write a paragraph
mechanism of indexing
indexing full text
index an inverted

xml aware indexing
aware indexing makes
sense than xml
xml unaware indexing
side of xml
increase and keywords
keywords are repeated
amount of combinational
kinds of elements
leads in increase
shows different xml
native xml databases
natix or goxml
built from scratch

taking is shown
conference management system
today are managed
web based interface
activities and data
requirements that make
simplified conference management
real life database
complete gory details
conference is decided
committee of people
people who decide
decide which paper
committee is headed
program committee chair
members of program
committee will act
act as reviewers
reviewers so people
set of requirements
paper is authored
unique contact author
paper is accepted
process of review
real life conferences
bit more relaxed
program committee member
kind of stringent
make things simpler
publish any papers
author may submit
submit a paper
summit a published
block of requirements
paper is reviewed
send a paper
reviewer will give
accept or reject
reject the paper
reject a paper
decision the reviewer
papers so based
based on reviewer
comments pc chair
prepares a set
set of paper
paper for acceptance
set of papers
papers are accepted
specific forbidden condition
number of requirements
requirements or number
number of things
required nor forbidden
reviewer can review
carefully the requirements
design our application
suppose you design
design a dbms
requirements neither requires
systems development life
development life cycle
system development life
systems requirements specifications
explicitly required conditions
explicitly forbidden conditions
high level design
turn you reduce
low level design
schema plus transactions
set of application
design from requirements
move from high
design to low
design these sets
sets of processes
processes involve human
involve human activity
activity or human
common with human
reflect the systems
systems requirements specs
reflect the requirement
two important concepts
designing real life
real life system
liveness and safety
definitions of liveness
safety liveness means
set of requirement
compromise the integrity
member may push
forbid the behavior
forbid this activities
forbidden usually constitutes
constitutes of safety
order to safe
guard the system
system against integrity
form to build
build a safe
build a system
violations ? simple
start the system
system that doesn
database system doesn
make a system
addition to safety
require certain behavior
behavior to happen
system should perform
perform certain activities
talk about mismatches
mismatches now suppose
systems requirements spec
set of forbidden
behavior or safety
final system model
denote the set
denotes the set
set of safety
talk about building
building a system
kinds of mismatches
talking about capturing
capturing user requirements
list of things
fact in addition
srs that means
model is incomplete
incomplete the srs
factor a subset
model actually forbids
incorrect it forbids
forbids certain required
model is performing
performing more activities
model has extraneous
suppose the model
model is doing
extraneous and unsafe
set of guidelines
model is good
separating the requirements
requirements into set
behavior and set
model is unsafe
forbid certain things
model is conservative
conservative now conservative
conservative again doesn
violating a liveness
hampering the liveness
building a safe
divide our requirements
kinds of required
real life examples
factor a requirements
behavior or liveness
behavior or set
required and forbidden
relationships between entities
complete er model
model and perform
conditions a paper
accept a paper
system should flag
reviewers each program
chair each paper
author that means
reviewer must comment
rejected or neutral
reviewer should give
accepted nor rejected
conditions and forbidden
model also forbids
forbids those conditions
step and start
start identifying entities
entity an entity
entity which kind
program committee headed
find several entities
logical existence program
existence program committee
essentially the nouns
reviewers so reviewers
similarly a paper
entity now author
author an attribute
author may write
relate to equate
equate that paper
entity called journal
finishing the identification
identification of entities
statements that connect
candidates for relationships
part already forms
forms a relationship
conference is handled
handled by program
technical program decided
explicit so conference
made program committee
entity ? first
existence is defined
defines a week
shown by double
remember er classes
committee totally participates
statement the technical
technical program committee
committee of large
chair heads program

chair is clear
chair can head
head any number
number of program
committee whatever headed
program committee consists
consists of reviewers
two separate relationships
form a consistent
violating a forbidden
violating a condition
rewrite this condition
entity called members
relationship so remember
remember the extended
extended er model
part of reviewer
chair and vice
committee would consist
consist of members
members where members
consist of reviewer
disjoint so committee
committee can consist
number of members
basically in addition
give a cardinality
relationships a paper
authored by authors
author can author

submit any number
number of papers
author who acts
answer the thing
relationship that states
thing after taking
draw the entire
set of relationships
entity called person
person and make
make a disjoint
specialization between member
entity called member
entity called author
talking in english
conference or journal
entities and form
form a union
form a single
conference and form
make an entity
entity called event
paper is submitted
thing is make
cardinality of event
calling a journal
sounding in terms

union of journal
reviewed by reviewers
papers is reviewed
statement a reviewer
paper that means
means the reviewer
give a result
result the result
reject or neutral
carefully the attribute
attribute called result
nt assign result
belong to relationships
instance not exist
