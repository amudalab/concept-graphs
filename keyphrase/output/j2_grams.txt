public class puppy
java also supports
supports singleton classes
class singleton classes
classes the singleton
singleton s purpose
control object creation
limiting the number
number of objects
singleton will occur
static fields singletons
singletons often control
access to resources
connections or sockets
driver has trouble
trouble with multithreading
connection is made
thread can access
access the connection
easiest implementation consists
field to hold
hold its result
static accessor method
static initializer block

method here classicsingleton
classicsingleton class employs
employs a technique
instantiation to create
create the singleton
ensures that singleton
instances are created
creating an object
blueprints for objects
basically an object
class in java
create new objects
steps when creating

categorizing the classes

interfaces when developing
applications in java
hundreds of classes
categorizing these classes
life much easier
easier import statements
includes the package
locate the source

giving the proper
compiler to find
class for example,the
example,the following line

simple case study
creating two classes
employee and employeetest
employeetest first open
first open notepad
save this source
employee.java the employee
four instance variables
designation and salary
salary the class
explicitly defined constructor
takes a parameter
parameter import java.io
designation ; double
class employee public
employee public employee
assign the age
variable age public
age public void
public void empage
age = empage
assign the designation
public void empdesignation
designation = empdesig
assign the salary
public void empsalary
salary = empsalary
print the employee
public void printemployee
method therefore in-order
run this employee
method and objects
