the/DT/the value/NN/value during/IN/during bit/NN/bit time/NN/time is/VBZ/is a/DT/a level/NN/level voltage/NN/voltage ;/:/; that/DT/that means/VBZ/means /,/, during/IN/during the/DT/the

time/NN/time ?/./? no/DT/no transition/NN/transition represents/VBZ/represents 0/-NONE-/0 and/CC/and transition/NN/transition from/IN/from low/JJ/low to/TO/to high/JJ/high or/CC/or from/IN/from high/JJ/high to/TO/to low/JJ/low is/VBZ/is a/DT/a 1/CD/1. so/RB/so the/DT/the same/JJ/same bit/NN/bit pattern/NN/pattern /,/, 0/-NONE-/0 0/-NONE-/0 1/CD/1 1/CD/1 0/-NONE-/0 1/CD/1 is/VBZ/is
