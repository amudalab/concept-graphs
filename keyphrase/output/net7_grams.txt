today is tcp
important transport protocol
complex then udp
transport layer responsibilities
transport layer creates
layer creates packets
packets from byte
byte steam received
order to multiplex
multiplex and de-multiplex
numbers to create
create process-to-process communication
sliding window protocol
protocol to achieve
achieve flow control
out and retransmission
retransmission to achieve
achieve error control
unreliable this seeks
seeks to provide
provide a reliable
communication that means
connection oriented protocol
kind of congestion
congestion control mechanism
thing of connecting
connecting between processors
two distant nodes
connection-oriented reliable transport
reliable transport protocol
protocol it adds
adds connection oriented
oriented and reliability
kind of service
connectionless whereas tcp
give some kind
kind of connection-oriented
connection and proposal
proposal is implemented
two end nodes
nodes that means
means the intermediate
role to play
reliable and ordered
ordered ordered means
means the packets
packets are received
received in order
packets will arrive
arrive in order
first may land
earlier and vice
versa but tcp
makes them ordered
ordered tcp brings
brings an order
tcp is point-to-point
point-to-point and unicast
reliable and unicast
flavor to tcp
tcp it takes
takes the byte-stream
full loop-less connection
connection that means
connected by tcp
flow and congestion
transmission control protocol
data transfer tcp
transfer tcp establishes
establishes a connection
network like classical
kinds of control
first a connection
connection is set
actual data transmission
data transmission begins
tcp a connection
two end points
transmission takes place
entity is waiting
tcp entity-client contacts
contacts the server
server the actual
procedure for setting
setting up connection
complex the client
client first makes
makes a request
acknowledges the request
request and accepts
data transfer begins
actual data transfer
reliable the byte-stream
byte-stream is broken
segments the receiver
receiver sends acknowledgements
acknowledgements for segments
reliability is brought
segment is acknowledged
acknowledged tcp maintains
maintains a timer
segment is retransmitted
mechanism for reliability
reliability the sender
sends a packet
lost and sends
sends the packet
packet again hoping
reach the receiver
receiver will send
send the acknowledgement
lead to duplicate
receiver has received
acknowledgement got lost
naturally the original
receive any acknowledgement
tcp can detect
detect errors tcp
tcp has checksum
checksum for header
header and data
data like udp
segment with invalid
checksums are discarded
discarded each byte
intermediate sequence number
number is missing
missing the receiver
lower layers tcp
layers tcp handles
tcp handles data
data in blocks
packets actually originate
higher layer tcp
layer tcp handles
sequence of bytes
boundaries between bytes
beginning and end
end of segments
stream of bytes
queues are bytes
queue of bytes
unit of data
transfer between devices
devices using tcp
bytes of option
protocol to run
bit source port
source port address
bit destination port
destination port address
options like window
options and padding
processes actually communicate
communicate through ports
address together form
form the socket
identifies every session
sides two port
two port numbers
numbers are assigned
assigned for standard
applications the first
communication will start
start on well-known
well-known port number
switch to ephemeral
ephemeral port numbers
address that defines
defines the port
sending the segment
bits the port
port numbers destination
numbers destination port
port address defines
receiving the segment
number it defines
defines the number
byte of data
segment during connection
establishment a random
random number generator
create an initial
initial sequence number
number of bits
number was small
starts it sends
sends the number
finite length sequence
length sequence number
back and starts
starts these numbers
small segment size
similarly other kinds
kinds of confusion
confusion might arise
large sequence number
number is generated
receiving very high
low sequence numbers
range of sequence
number and random
generate the initial
number this initial
sequence is expected
isn is exchanged
similarly these segments
stream of acknowledgements
number will start
set up phase
large it defines
defines the byte
segment is expecting
expecting to receive
length the header
bits for future
flags it defines
controls flags urg
flags urg defines
defines the urgent
pointer which determines
pointer is valid
valid the urgent
urgent pointer field
garbage ack tells
tells whether acknowledgement
acknowledgement is valid
request for push
resetting the connection
synchronize sequence number
number and fin
terminate these connections
connections these flags
termination of connections
bit which defines
defines the size
window in bytes
party must maintain
sort of controlled
receiver the receiver
bits the checksum
flag is set
set it defines
number to determine
determine the last
last urgent byte
single-byte or multiple-byte
multiple-byte in options
maximum segment size
windows scale factor
factor and timestamp
end of options
operation for padding
end of option
size which defines
chunk of data
taking the header
header field out
window scale factor
scale factor defines
timestamp is filled
filled by source
source when segment
leaves and destination
echo reply field
source to determine
determine the round
essential because suppose
sender is expecting
expecting an acknowledgement
make an estimate
estimate is based
round trip delay
maximum segment life
sender would sort
packet is lost
acknowledgement is lost
case the packet
calculation as udp
udp and inclusion
inclusion is mandatory
mandatory with tcp
setting up connections
connections and resetting
resetting of connections
path because remember
remember that tcp
tcp is working
underlying actual service
connectionless but tcp
thing that means
means all good
things about connection
orientation like segments
arriving in order
order and reliability
present but tcp
connectionless ip network
established from source
path unlike traditional
unlike traditional strict
traditional strict connection-oriented
strict connection-oriented service
establishment four actions
actions are required
required before sending
actions first host
host a sends
sends a segment
establish a connection
segment to announce
connection and includes
includes its initialization
host b sends
segment to acknowledge
acknowledge the request
back an acknowledgement
segment that includes
includes the initialization
means the host
request of host
send the initialization
initialization information meaning
meaning the sequence
synchronization the sender
sends a synchronization
request to set
number the receiver
receiver then sends
sends a syn
syn the sequence
consumes the first
first sequence number
acknowledging it sends
sends the value
receiver is expecting
tcp is sitting
send the syn
sends the sequence
sends sequence number1200
number1200 it replies
transmission can start
termination to terminate
terminate the connection
connection either party
party can close
close the connection
connection if connection
connection is terminated
data can continue
full loop-less communication
communication which means
side is sending
side the acknowledgement
acknowledgement is coming
initialize the termination
required to close
segment announcing connection
announcing connection termination
termination this means
means it sends
sends the segments
segments containing fin
acknowledging the request
connection is closed
finished sending data
data it sends
segment indicating connection
indicating connection closure
sort of allowing
allowing the termination
termination of connection
things to send
indicating a connection
connection closure host
host a acknowledges

receives the fin
back an ack
side is sequence
sends a fin
closing the connection
network is unreliable
fin is missed
send the fin
send this fin
sending this acknowledgement
acknowledgement the sender
sender will assume
send any ack
ack any longer
closed that means
means no connection
connection is active
active or pending
server is waiting
incoming call syn
call syn rcvd
syn rcvd means
made a request
request has arrived
waiting for acknowledgement
client has started
started to open
open a connection
connection established means
means a connection
normal data transfer
data transfer state
transfer state fin
state fin wait
finished fin wait
server has agreed
agreed to release
release timed wait
timed wait means
wait means wait
wait for pending
msl wait state

close simultaneously close
simultaneously close wait
close wait means
wait means server
server has initiated
initiated a release
ack is waiting
syn or syn
syn plus ack
ack it receives
syn rcvd state
state as explained
reaches the established
two way communication
control is implemented
implemented by tcp
tcp this defines
defines the amount
amount of data
data a source
source can send
send before receiving
receiving an acknowledgment
buffer of data
data to limit
limit the amount
traditional sliding window
protocol a sliding
transmission more efficient
control the flow
flow of data
overwhelmed with data
number or packets
packets or segments
sending these bytes
case the sender
acknowledgment comes suppose
buffer the destination
consuming the data
suppose the size
receiver window size
size the point
sender may send
lot of packets
sender will push
lot of data
make the congestion
reach that side
buffer has overflowed
router has dropped
dropped some packets
size the window
effective data transfer
transfer is taking
sending two segments
segments the sender
acknowledgment comes back
acknowledgement the packet
packet will reach
acknowledgment will travel
delay now suppose
suppose the window
sending each segment
byte you wait
minimum possible rate
rate at witch
witch the sender
sender is sending
large a large
data transfer speed
byte its waiting
send any acknowledgement
sender will realize
gap is closed
put in proper
sequence because sequence
protocol is reliable
acknowledged the window
sending some packets
network is congested
reducing the window
control the congestion
built into tcp
details about congestion
tcp the sender
sender window size
receiver window value
number of empty
actual window size
send a full
worth of data
increased or decreased
destination the destination
destination can send
send an acknowledgment
transport protocol tcp
protocol tcp delivers
delivers the entire
end in order
order without error
lost or duplicated
duplicated so tcp
tcp provides reliability
reliability using error
things that tcp
detects corrupt segments
detecting lost segments
out of order
detecting duplicated segments
detected detecting corrupt
detecting corrupt segments
correct the error
segments is achieved
number is lost
missing detecting segments
detect and correct
lost or delayed
detection is achieved
acknowledgement and time-out
give a time-out
things together offer
reliability and error
detection and correction
capability of tcp
correction when time-out
time-out counter expires
counter expires segment

arrives the router
forward one copy
reach some members
building a source-based
set routing tables
packets that arrive
arrive on rpf
non-rpf interfaces receiver
interfaces receiver drops
receiver drops packets
packets not received
received on rpf
interfaces these routers
require the capability
capability of forwarding
forwarding multiple copies
bearing this address
non-rpf this means
interface it means
neighbor is coming
member ? first
distributed and dynamic
system so things
router is concerned
packet is dropped
pruning is sending
sending a prune
packet is received
non rpf interface
igmp always finding
members of group
member has retired
group that means
sending your igmp
local contributor member
prune has retired
send a prune
prune message stating
send anymore packets
send the prune
naturally it drops
drops this packet
local member sends
sends a prune
message it means
send the local
received a prune
non rpf interfaces
interfaces that means
source to distant
longer a member
back a prune
destination that prunes
prunes this link
message temporarily disables
disables a routing
routing table entry
removes a link
cases the prune
disabling a routing
entry the question
reactivate a pruned
pruned routing table
reactivate this link
sending a graft
graft message disables
message disables prune
prune and reactivates
reactivates the routing
pruning and grafting
grafting are complimentary
prune to disable
graft to enable
kind of situation
communications that means
sends a join
message to rpf
neighbor with respect
respect to core
join messages creates
source sends data
core forwards data
source we put
put a star
star in place
links get messages
