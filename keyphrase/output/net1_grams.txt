discuss the network
basically a computer
number of nodes
call a graph
representing the network
network this graph
structure we talk
structure this structure
general not feasible
pair of node
matter of discussion
nodes may represent
computer or network
devices like switches
links represent communication
represent communication links
communication links modes
modes of communication
broadcast or point
point to point
lan topologies lan
local area network
network and local
area network topologies
ring and bus
kind of network
shared broadcast link
pair of communicating
send his message
ignore the communication
links are shared
ignore this communication
protocol to decide
communications will collide
shared broadcast medium
medium the communication
pairs of node
cable a single
single cable connects
computers are hanging
cable each computer
computer is connected
cable so computers
computers must synchronize
computer to transmit
single copper cable
cable and computers
network is maintained
single cable cable
cable cable segment
segment must end
sends a signal
kind of unwanted
types of coaxial
thin coaxial cable
cable called thin
thick coaxial cable
cable called thick
lan and extra
daisy chain manner
manner this technology
technology is sort
thin and thick
people are moving
problem in communication
obsolete these days
single broadcast medium
machines are sharing
topology is ieee
eliminate that cable
cable and replace
range of segment
meters the maximum
number of connections
devices four repeaters
total cable length
signal gets weak
regenerate the signal
incoming weak signal
send the stronger
line the maximum
nodes per segment
advantages and disadvantages
easy to add
cable and add
add new station
station that means
computer the amount
amount of cable
recommended which means
parts any longer
out of fashion
number of devices
difficult to isolate
isolate the problems
slows the response
direct point-to-point communication
communication that means
dedicated point-to-point communication
communication so computers
computers are connected
connected by communication

pairs of nodes
flexibility in communication
security and privacy
privacy because communication
number of cables
cables you require
means the number
length of cables
kind of cable
previous thin lan
kind of structure
area network suppose
means every node
node and length
nodes this means
easy to provide
kind of mesh
alternative another reason
two different buildings
lot of cables
reduce the number
number of communication
idea of communicating
lan it means
necessarily we share
share the connections
ways of doing
computer takes turns
include some technique
technique for synchronizing
common these days
topology a star
nodes are connected
star its physical
hub is made
advantage of converting
previously a bus
cable the cable
handle the connections
long running cable
difficult to locate
locate loose connections
find out failures
physical star topology
topology still maintains
maintains a logical
logical bus topology
case these days
previous star diagram
diagram is idealized
kind of connection
ubiquitous these cables
kind of cables
cables which connect
connect your telephones
cables or unshielded
unshielded twisted pair
twisted pair cables
easier to handle
cheaper these connections
lan or thick
extended star topology
means different stars
manner that means
means the hubs
stars are connected
switches these switches
switches are connected
topology some part
medium some part
coaxial cable running
leaving a thin
topology in ring
lot of advantage
first node passes
passes the data
reaches the destination
reach the destination
destination will copy
short connected cable
ring ring connections
connections may run
run past offices
offices with connector
cables to sockets
ring the data
put two rings
reason for putting
putting two rings
nodes can sense
sort of wrap
wrap the ring
nodes these nodes
node may break
link may fail
things may happen
wide area network
lot of things
exchanges are connected
fashion using fiber
fiber optics cable
cable is cut
beginning or end
ring all devices
devices have equal
access to media
media one good
ring allows fault
tolerance each device
wait its turn
turn to transmit
transmit that means
token ring token
ring token ring
ieee standard number
data it reaches
data is extracted
acknowledgement of receipt
back to transmitting
empty token passed
make a data
kind of identification
bunch of data
data the destination
extract the data
acknowledgement and send
remove this acknowledgement
token is passed
send and send
disadvantages the advantages
data packets travel
travel at great
reason why data
packets can travel
synchronizing their actions
two different nodes
nodes may start
data will collide
ways of synchronization
easier to find
faults and rectify
faults and terminators
cable the disadvantages
requires more cable
couple of breakdowns
breakdowns may bring
bring the entire
ring down smaller
smaller rings exist
rings exist nowadays
network is concerned
network a ring
matter of fact
fact the ring
topology that wide
topology use token
passing for synchronized
ring the ring
single shared communication
shared communication medium
communication medium bits
medium bits pass
pass from transmitter
past other computers
copied by destination
designed to pass
out of commission
ring can function
computer is shut
sender holding token
holding token transmits
token transmits bits
bits of frames
computer not holding
holding the token
passes the bits
speed the destination
makes a copy

network could work
token after transmission
transmission computer transmits
computer transmits token
ready to transmit
transmit it receives
transmits this token
fell into disuse
token ring devices
