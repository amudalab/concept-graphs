growth of computers
development of networks
utility and importance
scene in mid-1960s
department of defense
wanted a command
command and control
survive a nuclear
wanted a distributed
project the subnet
subnet should consists
intermediate message processors
kind of early
early network devices
lines these imps
imps ? intermediate
connected by telephone
lines from telephone
software was changed
changed to terminal
terminal interface processor
allowed the connection
connection of terminals
setup a machine
universities could dial
people were interested
upgraded their systems
ways in mid-1980s
mid-1980s nsf built
backbone to connect
connect with super
super computing centers
networks its backbone
mbps fiber backbone
allowed network connection
connection to thousands
thousands of universities
commercial houses began
began to notice
decentralized model began
commercial people joined
lot of innovation
lot of people
major driving forces
role of so-called
start up companies
companies start-up companies
start-up companies means
buy their company
company or give
give them money
kind of technology
people got interested
.com companies crashed
field of networks
walks of life
kind of structure
mentioned that computer
number of nodes
nodes and nodes
computers or network
lines sometimes things
giving us point-to-point
communication that means
means one node
physically a copper
line or fiber
means that communication
means the communication
kinds of dedicated
share a point
point to point
medium that means
ais and bis
bis could communicate
done this business
business of sharing
sharing a link
sharing this link
link by multiple
kinds of point-to-point
links but point-to-point
kind of link
throws its signal
make temporary point-to-point
temporary point-to-point links
broadcast tv signals
shared between multiple
multiple access medium
users are connected
kind of medium
protocol of deciding
kind of protocol
protocol called multiple
shared broadcast medium
broadcasting and point-to-point
send some things
group of friends
computer networks networks
networks are divided
divided into local
local area network
metropolitan area network
wide area network
area network local
network local area
area network means
building or small
group of buildings
size is small
things about local
make the issues
issues of local
larger area network
picture ? ownership

networking metropolitan area
means a network
size is bigger
bigger than local
local area networks
make the entire
entire community networked
geographically more distributed
simply draw valve
connect the people
area network wide
network wide area
wide area networks
hundreds or thousands
thousands of kilometers
kilometers the communication
interested in network
number of people
input into bringing
make things cheaper
thing became cheaper
cheaper and cheaper
wanted to join
join the network
area network cost

connect various local
network of networks
networks or internetwork
internetwork or internet
networks in general
general in formal
protocols in network
protocols in networks
networks because networks
done if people
basis to communicate
numbers of protocols
protocol these protocols
two different interfaces
interface that defines
defines the operations
protocol and peer
peer to peer
interface which defines
defines messages exchanged
exchanged with peer
protocol this protocol
protocol is supposed
supposed to achieve
business is broken
functioning of computer
networks we break
networks are organized
organized as series
series of layers
layers the task
give some service
maintains a virtual
peer any layer
running the peer-to-peer
interface the task
performs certain subtask
performs some task
similarly for performing
performing this task
layer this layer
subtask is done
peer-to-peer protocol running
layers the interface
defined another point
connection ? virtual
virtual connection means
means that physical
computers are connected
connected by wire
connected in order
hopping from node
node to node
reaching its destination
direct physical communication
surfing the internet
connected to opposite
remote web server
virtual the physical
piece of wires
wires or fiber
fiber optic links
connection for running
node is transparent
means some company
upper layer service
two particular layers
two particular nodes
protocol is concerned
expecting these kinds
kinds of answer
kinds of messages
kind of answer
companies are free
free to develop
develop their product
people can innovate
people can put
network operating system
complexity is special
implementer one implementer
implementer has decided
decided to implement
lot of details
fairly general picture
networking is done
business of developing
nuts and bolts
peers all agree
changing the protocol
communication will breakdown
thing about layering
change i make
specifics of implementation
tells the process
osi reference model
widely used osi
important tcp reference
tcp reference model
kind of reference
basically a description
layer is supposed
number of layers
stacks we call
protocol stacks exits
lot of thought
data link layer
order that people
people can communicate
layers ? application
link and physical
layer each layer
kind of functionality
functionalities together give
adds a header
sends the message
scheme the point
suppose we start
case of osi
layer some communication
layer this application
application layer program
program is running
doing a telnet
kind of thing
start a telnet
telnet client program
machine will respond
respond to telnet
server can respond
telnet client telnet
client telnet server
layer how telnet
application layer protocol
client will request
server will respond
internals of telnet
program is concerned
idea of layering
layering so give
data to send
kinds of data
node the lower
running a protocol
layer is running
message to add
add to give
fatter and fatter
out the message
sending a message
message is received
header that means
machine that means
means some dos
two different machines
layer will add
thing becomes data
session layer session
layer session layer
data becomes fatter
fat packet travels
layer will strip
peers can communicate
transmit the bits
difference between transmitting
bits and transmitting
matter of data
data link computers
route the packets
segregated and put
original application layer
concept of packet
layer the session
manages the virtual
layer it manages
connection the presentation
layer that means
encode and decode
messages that means
two different ways
ways of encoding
job the human
user is interested
variety of protocols
things ; examples
sending a mail
telneting that means
means the telnet
machine as part
reliable and cheap
layer is concerned
peer some examples
examples of peers
nodes given service
application layer hands
layer which handles
handles the format
computers to share
share a connection
packetize this data
user is concerned
