operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/1 module 1  introduction to operating system operating system  or shortly os  primarily provides services for running applications on a computer system need for an os  the primary need for the os arises from the fact that user needs to be provided with services and os ought to facilitate the provisioning of these services the central part of a computer system is a processing engine called cpu a system should make it possible for a user s application to use the processing unit a user application would need to store information the os makes memory available to an application when required similarly  user applications need use of input facility to communicate with the application this is often in the form of a key board  or a mouse or even a joy stick  if the application is a game for instance   the output usually provided by a video monitor or a printer as some times the user may wish to generate an output in the form of a printed document output may be available in some other forms for example it may be a video or an audio file let us consider few applications document design accounting e-mail image processing operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/2 games we notice that each of the above application requires resources for processing information storage of information mechanism to inputting information provision for outputting information these service facilities are provided by an operating system regardless of the nature of application the os offers generic services to support all the above operations these operations in turn facilitate the applications mentioned earlier to that extent an os operation is application neutral and service specific user and system view  from the user point of view the primary consideration is always the convenience it should be easy to use an application in launching an application  it helps to have an icon which gives a clue which application it is we have seen some helpful clues for launching a browser  e-mail or even a document preparation application in other words  the human computer interface which helps to identify an application and its launch is very useful this hides a lot of details of the more elementary instructions that help in selecting the application similarly  if we examine the programs that help us in using input devices like a key board all the complex details of character reading program are hidden from the user the same is true when we write a program for instance  when we use a programming language like c  a printf command helps to generate the desired form of output the following figure essentially depicts the basic schema of the use of os from a user stand point however  when it comes to the view point of a system  the os needs to ensure that all the system users and applications get to use the facilities that they need operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/3 also  os needs to ensure that system resources are utilized efficiently for instance  there may be many service requests on a web server each user request need to be serviced similarly  there may be many programs residing in the main memory the system need to determine which programs are active and which need to await some form of input or output those that need to wait can be suspended temporarily from engaging the processor this strategy alone enhances the processor throughput in other words  it is important for an operating system to have a control policy and algorithm to allocate the system resources the evolution  it would be worthwhile to trace some developments that have happened in the last four to five decades in the 1960s  the common form of computing facility was a mainframe computer system the mainframe computer system would be normally housed in a computer center with a controlled environment which was usually an air conditioned area with a clean room like facility the users used to bring in a deck of punched cards which encoded the list of program instructions the mode of operation was as follows  user would prepare a program as a deck of punched cards the header cards in the deck were the job control cards which would indicate which compiler was to be used  like fortran / cobol compilers   the deck of cards would be handed in to an operator who would collect such jobs from various users computer hardware operating system system and application programs user 1 user 2 user n operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/4 the operators would invariably group the submitted jobs as fortran jobs  cobol jobs etc in addition  these were classified as long jobs that required considerable processing time or short jobs which required a short and limited computational time each set of jobs was considered as a batch and the processing would be done for a batch like for instance there may be a batch of short fortran jobs the output for each job would be separated and turned over to users in a collection area this scenario clearly shows that there was no interactivity users had no direct control also  at any one time only one program would engage the processor this meant that if there was any input or output in between processing then the processor would wait idling till such time that the i/o is completed this meant that processor would idling most of the time as processor speeds were orders of magnitude higher than the input or output or even memory units clearly  this led to poor utilization of the processor the systems that utilized the cpu and memory better and with multiple users connected to the systems evolved over a period of time as shown in table1.1  at this time we would like to invoke von  neumann principle of stored program operation for a program to be executed it ought to be stored in the memory in the scheme of things discussed in the previous paragraph  we notice that at any time only one program was kept in the memory and executed in the decade of 70s this basic mode of operation was altered and system designers contemplated having more than one program resident in the memory this clearly meant that when one program is awaiting operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/5 completion of an input or output  another program could  in fact  engage the cpu late 60 s and early 70 s storing multiple executables  at the same time  in the main memory is called multiprogramming with multiple excutables residing in the main memory  the immediate consideration is  we now need a policy to allocate memory and processor time to the resident programs it is obvious that by utilizing the processor for another process when a process is engaged in input or output the processor utilization and  therefore  its output are higher overall  the multiprogramming leads to higher throughput for this reason multiprogramming while multiprogramming did lead to enhanced throughput of a system  the systems still essentially operated in batch processing mode 1980 s in late 70s and early part of the decade of 80s the system designers offered some interactivity with each user having a capability to access system this is the period when the timeshared systems came on the scene basically  the idea is to give every user an illusion that all the system resources were operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/6 available to him as his program executed to strengthen this illusion a clever way was devised by which each user was allocated a slice of time to engage the processor during the allocated time slice a users program would be executed now imagine if the next turn for the same program comes quickly enough  the user would have an illusion that the system was continuously available to his task this is what precisely time sharing systems attempted giving each user a small time slice and returning back quickly enough so that he never feels lack of continuity in fact  he carries an impression that the system is entirely available to him alone timeshared systems clearly require several design considerations these include the following  how many programs may reside in the main memory to allow  and also sustain timesharing what should be the time slice allocated to process each program how would one protect a users program and data from being overwritten by another users program basically  the design trends that were clearly evident during the decade of 1970-80 were  achieve as much overlapping as may be feasible between i/o and processing bulk storage on disks clearly witnessed a phenomenal growth this also helped to implement the concept to offer an illusion of extended storage the concept of virtual storage came into the vogue the virtual storage essentially utilizes these disks to offer enhanced addressable space the fact that only that part of a program that is currently active need be in the main memory also meant that multi-programming could support many more programs in fact this could be further enhanced as follows  1 only required active parts of the programs could be swapped in from disks 2 suspended programs could be swapped out this means that a large number of users can access the system this was to satisfy the notion that computing facility be brought to a user as opposed to the notion that the user go to compute  the fact that a facility is brought to a user gives the notion of a utility or a service in its true sense in fact  the pc truly reflects the notion of computing utility  it is regarded now as a personal productivity tool operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/7 swapping of program parts main memory  disc  vice-versa it was in early 1970s bell laboratory scientists came up with the now well known os  unix also  as the microcomputers came on scene in 1980s a forerunner to current dos was a system called cp/m the decade of 1980s saw many advances with the promise of networked systems one notable project amongst these was the project athena at mit in usa the project forms the basis to several modern developments the client-server paradigm was indeed a major fall out the users could have a common server to the so called x-terminals the x windows also provided many widgets to support convenient human computer interfaces using x windows it is possible to create multiple windows in fact each of the windows offers a virtual terminal in other words it is possible to think about each of these windows as a front-end terminal connection so it is possible to launch different applications from each of the windows this is what you experience on modern day pc which also supports such an operating environment cp/m based computer networking topologies like star  ring and general graphs  as shown in the figure  were being experimented with protocols for communication amongst computers evolved in in our discussions  we shall discuss many of the above issues in greater detail as we move to later chapters on the micro-computer front the development was aimed at relieving the processor from handling input output responsibilities the i/o processing was primarily handled by two mechanisms  one was bios and the other was the graphics cards to drive the display the processor now was relieved from regulating the i/o this made it possible to utilize the processor more effectively for other processing tasks with the advent of 1990s the computer communication was pretty much the order of the day operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/8 particular  the tcp/ip suite of network protocols were implemented the growth in the networking area also resulted in giving users a capability to establish communication between computers it was now possible to connect to a remote computer using a telnet protocol it was also possible to get a file stored in a remote location using a file transfer  ftp  protocol all such services are broadly called network services x x x  a  star  b  ring  c  tree let s now briefly explore where the os appears in the context of the software and application let s consider a scenario where we need to embed the computer system in an industrial application this may be regulating the temperature of a vessel in a process control in a typical process control scenario monitoring initializes and activates the hardware input reads the values from sensors and stores it in register decision checks whether the readings are within the range output responds to the situation scenario  a temperature monitoring chemical process operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/9 what we need  a supervisory program to raise an alarm when temperature goes beyond a certain band the desired sequence of operational events  measure input temperature  process the most recent measurement  perform an output task the computer system may be employed in a variety of operational scenarios like a bank  airlines reservation system  university admissions and several others in each of these we need to provide the resources for processing user access to the system storage and management of information protection of information against accidental and intentional misuse support for data processing activities communication with i/o devices management of all activities in a transparent manner let s now review what does an os do power on self test  post  resource management operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/10 support for multi-user error handling communication support over network  optional  deadline support so that safety critical application run and fail gracefully operational view  let s briefly look at the underlying principle of operation of a computer system current systems are based on the von-neumann principle the principle states that a program is initially stored in memory and executed by fetching an instruction at a time the basic cycle of operation is fetch an instruction  fetch  interpret the instruction  decode  execute the instruction  execute  modern systems allow multiple users to use a computer system even on a stand alone pc there may be multiple application which are running simultaneously for instance  we have a mail program receiving mails  a clock to display time while we may be engaged in browsing a word process in other words os need to schedule the processor amongst all the application simultaneously without giving an impression that the processor time is being divided and scheduled per an application an operational overview  processor schedule and allocate processor time operating cycle memory map operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/11 memory executes program and access data input output devices communication with devices mutual exclusion schedule the usage of shared device and fair access shell of an os human computer interface  hci/chi  a modern computer system the peripheral devices communicate in a mode known as interrupt mode .typically human input is considered important and often uses this mode this is so because human desire to guide the operation for instance  we use a mouse click or a key board input these require immediate attention by needing an appropriate interruption service operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/12 processes and tools  processes  most oss support a notion that a program in execution may be regarded as a process clearly  with multiple applications active at the same time there are many processes that are active the os needs to manage all these processes often applications may spawn processes that need to communicate with each other such inter process communication forms the primary basis of distributed computing with the coming together of communications network and computers it is possible to create processes on one machine and seek services from another machine the machine seeking the services is called client machine and the machine offering services is called server machine when you use a web browser  your computer is the client and the machine which provides the content for browsing is the web server all modern oss support client-server operations for service provisioning tools  one important issue is  how does one use the services efficiently in addition to the device handling utilities  most oss provide many other general purpose utilities as a set of packaged tools the tools help us to think in terms of higher level of operations in the absence of tools and tool kits we would be required to write a fresh program each time operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/13 as an example  consider a sort utility in unix it supports identification of fields in a file with multi field structured data sort allows us to sort on a chosen field on a file imagine if we had to write a sort program every time we had a set of records making a file also look at the support we derive from the compression software tools like compression of files for long-term storage or transmission  zip tools in windows environment   it would be stupendous task to write a compression program for every file transfer trends in computing  in this section we shall examine other trends in computing the application scenario can considerably influence the types of services that need to be managed by an operating system one such example is the emergence of parallel computing parallel computing  there are many problem solving situations like weather forecasting  image processing  statistical data analysis and simulation  pharmaceutical drug synthesis and others where using a single processor becomes a limiting factor parallel computing file server recording pc switch processing nodes the emergence of micro-computer  in particular apple mackintosh  offered improvement in the manner in which human computer interfaces could be utilized for i/o and also for launching the applications apple was the first computer system to use mouse clicks to launch application it also was the first environment to offer a drag and drop facility in fact this set trends to offer icon driven convenient ways of launching applications apple mac computer for this class of problems one has to resort to parallel processing in a parallel processing environment we may have a problem split in such a way that different parts of the same problem use a different processor with minimal communication parallel processing together with the network based services supports a mode of computing which is referred some times as distributed computing in distributed computing environment it is also possible to support distribution of data  files and execution of processes operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/14 in some other situation a computer system may be a part of a control system for instance  the system may be utilized for regulating a utility like electrical power supply there is usually an elaborate instrumentation to keep track of the health of plant or a process in these situations the instrumentation monitors physical quantities like pressure  temperature or speed and the process needs to respond in a real-time mode to be able to regulate the operation of the system real  time systems  another category of real-time systems are those that are used to offer services like atm  automatic teller machine  or airlines reservation systems the systems of the latter kind are often called transaction oriented systems this is because the basic information processing involves a transaction atm temperature in a process vessel exceeds a certain limit the operating system used in such real-time systems is often referred to as rtos in addition  to the above kind of systems  we are now witnessing emergence of a class of systems that are embedded within an application for instance  it is not unusual to find up to four microprocessors in a car these may be used for regulating fuel injection  cruise control or even operation of brakes similarly  there are microcontrollers embedded in washing machines the presence of these systems as an example  consider processing a request like withdrawing money it is a financial transaction  which requires updating accounts within an acceptable response time both the process control systems and transaction oriented systems are real time systems in which the response time to a request is critical the main objective is to assure timeliness in response the transaction oriented systems may even use the computer network extensively and often the process control systems may be bus based or may have local area network as well both these systems invariably recognize an event and offer a response in a transaction oriented system like atm  it may be a card input in a process control system an event may be detected when the operating systems/introduction to operating system lecture notes pcp bhatt/iisc  bangalore m1/v1/june 04/15 is totally transparent to the user he does not experience the presence of the system while using the gadgets this is because the operating environment only requires minimal control buttons and response panels the embedded systems are designed completely with a different philosophy these are not general purpose computing environments instead  these have dedicated mode of operation in these cases the operating system is not aimed at raising through put with general purpose utility back-ups instead these systems are designed with minimal and dedicated services the minimal service provisioning is done using a minimal os kernel often called micro-kernel a well known simputer wireless systems  wireless systems in general allow access from any where any time these are also called ubiquitous systems the ubiquity comes from the fact that unlike a wired system  the medium of communication is air which can be utilized from anywhere anytime finally  the other major trend which we are witnessing now is driven by web the world wide web all modern systems are internet compliant and allow a user to connect to the rest of the world web offers commercial organizations to offer their merchandise on the web also  it gives the consumers an opportunity to seek services using the web in our country now web is quite extensively utilized for railway reservation and also for the air ticket booking web can also offer other services for example  down loading music is common web can  and in due course of time will  offer services which are currently offered by operating systems in fact  then we will have the paradigm where network is the computer as was proclaimed by the sun ceo  scott mcnealy a few years ago embedded system is a common mobile phone and a personal digital assistant  pda   one important indian contribution in this class of systems is a simputer a simputer can be utilized as a pda simputer can also be used in a dedicated application simputers have also been upgraded to support wireless connectivity
