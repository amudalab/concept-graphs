stream of information
successor of pdh
pdh few years
wide area network
area network part
lot of problems
problems and complications
improvement of services
signals are transmitted
significant instance occur
sonet was introduced
number of achievements
multiplexing using multiples
rate and sts-n
important the point
multiplexing the original
signals will travel
international multiplexing standard
standard was first
achieved in sonet
sonet what happened
rate which people
kinds of differences
differences as technology
sort of countries
rate of transmission
basic building block
block of sonnet
stated the optical
optical signal standard
standard for interconnecting
interconnecting multiple vendor
multiple vendor equipment
equipment the point
electrical signal standards
electrical signal standard
bring together multiple
vendors to agree
achievement in sonet
sonet was extensive
maintaining the system
administrating the system
flexible in sonet
sonet when compared
kind of flexibility
matter of fact
strong in sonet
discuss this aspect
talk about protection
points in sonet
formats for existing

place in vacuum
kinds of histories
doing and put
kinds of things
bring together previous
achievement these existing
ds0 and ds0
kbps line rate

achievement of sonet
popular in europe
development in usa
sonet got introduced
sonet and sdh
part of world
problem so bringing
bridging the atlantic
accommodates other applications
kind of hierarchy
accommodated in sonet
flexibility is achieved
recovery from failure
talking about protection
terminal equipment failure
deploy a sonet
fashion and sonet
sonet can recover
give the so-called
so-called career great
career great service
absolutely not acceptable

extremely precise timing
things are synchronous
things become synchronous
derive a lot
lot of advantages
sonet provides support
support for operation
feed into sonet
nowadays but earlier
rates which existed
lack of synchronicity

advantage of sonet
sonet over pdh
kind of bandwidth
bandwidth ? small
small in relative
streams or communications
fatter that means
faster and faster
allowed in sonet
great it enhanced
control and administrative
point of view
view of service
