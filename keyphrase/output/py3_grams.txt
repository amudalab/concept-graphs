tuesday that week
week the midterm
regular lecture room
lecture room june
class who requires
requires a volunteer
disability by signing
posting your notes
make a significant
individual s capacity
person to accessibility
huron st suite
notice the quality
improves through volunteering
receive a certificate
certificate of recognition
change an immutable
lot of work
things like ints
ints and strings
takes a lot
things like images
object without keeping
keeping the original
making a big
tossing the rest
rest is wasteful
allowed to change
functions that change
ints are immutable
aliasing let pic
sets the green
pics are mutable
show a picture
aliasing and functions
calls a function
bunch of assignment
parameters are assigned
local variable refers
functions can change
change mutable objects
immutable ones june
slow in high-dimensional
high-dimensional spaces python
grouping similar items
i-1 because lists
lists are indexed
element list named
list named list_name
lists are mutable
index into lists
lists are heterogeneous
lists themselves june
functions and methods
returns the length
return the min
min and max
returns the sum
sum of elements
numbered not defined
defined for lists
lists of strings
adds the value
sorts the list
inserts the element
index specified remove
removes the first
instance of value
counts the number
number of instances
instances of value
looping over lists
loops for item
item in list
item = list
tricky with immutable
objects for item
item is immutable
alter the list
returns an ordered
list of ints
j-1 inclusive range
returns a list
ints so range
modify a list
element by element
makes a list
beginning to j-1
worried about aliasing
make a tuple
items are referenced
referenced by tuple_name
single element tuples
strings revisted strings
tuples of individual
strings can reference
reference individual characters
characters by string
defined on strings
string methods revisted
index into strings
string methods find
give the index
matching the substring
character exists rfind
lists because lists
lists of lists
represent a grid
grid or higher
higher dimenstional space
elements by list_name
item in list_name
item2 in item
