principles of counting
utter the word
sound very familiar
feel very comfortable
computing the probability
basically probability theory
theory is estimating
estimating the possibility
possibility of outcome
probable the event
done by counting
giving you axioms
axioms of probability
concepts of counting
chosen as mother
mother and child
number of possibilities
choosing the mother
appointed or chosen
chosen the mother
number of choices
sort of broke
call it event
event of choosing
year by first
chose the mother
sort of formulate
principle of counting
performed and experiment
experiment was choosing
choosing the year
choose the mother
first experiment results
outcome of experiment
outcomes of experiment
understand this basic
things become simple
define the concept
event can occur
generalize this concept
concept of counting
generalized basic principle
start saying first
first two experiments
number of outcomes
principle of computing

first four places
occupied by letters
letters and last
four by numbers
quoted the generalized
choosing the first

authors and call
call the authors
call the author
wanting to make
books and arrangements
count the thing
arranging the books
differentiating the books
place the choice
left with picking
out the book
order b arrangement
call the book
author is occupying
occupying the 2nd
place them depends
novels as novels
worry about differentiating
books with respect
arrangements will amount
leave the math
physics book intact
leave everything intact
disturb the arrangement
whichever comes first
counting the arrangement
number of arrangements

application to reliability
reliability theory failure
theory failure law
applications to reliability
theory that means
lot of dependence
systems ’ functioning
beam under load
source of stress
fly at high
lot of friction
sort of stress
writing the number
kind of stress
things will change
change or things
things will happen
system that means
talk of state
state of failure
beam can crack
fuse can burn
wing can buckle
pressure or stress
stress that system
system is facing
system will stop
failure or life
components under identical
stress may fail
things just stop
system will work
lot of unpredictability
manner of failure
failure also varies
beam will crack
fuse will burn
working one moment
moment will fail
suddenly you find
radio was functioning
weaker and weaker
construct a probabilistic
treat the life
lot of tools
components or systems
define the reliability
probability t greater
length is greater
component is greater
write as equal
write the reliability
denote the capital
cdf of cumulative
express the liability
associate another function
function with reliability
talking about exponential
introduced this hazard
simply i showed
kinds of hazard
condition to impose
component has failed
covers the failure
capital t lying
intersection actually means
delta t divided
theorem of integral
written as delta
interval of integration
exist a value
real number psi
integral calculus divided
interval is small
psi is close
represents the proportion
continue to work
rate the converse
determine your pdf
pdf f uniquely
variable with pdf
compute my pdf
sort of compute
start the function
component is working
system may fail
talking of reliability
system starts functioning
write r prime
minus r prime
life length random
length random variable
variable t uniquely
remember your definition
defining expected value
write as integral
variable t varies
value over random
study various failure
laws that means
modeling certain situations
situations for reliability
defining your reliability
show how important
study these failure
two basic tools
underlying failure laws
laws are reasonable
compile the failure
test we discussed
normal failure law
law is considered
fitting the data
describing the normal
sigma mu minus
area is left
mode that means
failure will occur
variable t takes
failure law implies
value and number
number of failures
minus mu decreases
decreases in absolute
failures will decrease
normal failures law
failures take place
satisfying this mod
mod t minus
failures will occur
minus probability capital
standardized normal variant
probability t minus
minus mu divided
phi t minus
area is equal
half the area
kind of curve
reliability function decreases
values become smaller
make t minus
standard normal thing
suppose the failure
find the value
standardize the normal
normal this variant
studying the failure
compute the reliability
instruments start functioning
normal distribution extend
extend from minus
curve should lie
handle this situation
truncated normal distribution
distribution that means
truncated this portion
complicate your computations
ageing is permanent
prove to show
show good results
distribution and viable
exponential failure law
define the exponential
defining the pdf
takes positive values
rate that means
law is exponential
exponential law failure
law failure law
determine the function
alpha e raise
immediately you compute
done this computation
greater than capital
capital t greater
rate is constant
done this part
introduced the exponential
defined the hazard
discuss this part
obtain your pdf
constant failure rate
pdf is negative
life time random
random variable assuming
assuming all non-negative
failure rate implies
change with sign
long the component
ways of describing
describing the situations
effect that means
stress or load
suddenly it fails
kind of load
load or stress
kind of failure
model by exponential
failure law weibull
law weibull law
discussing the exponential
laws very important
show the varying
varying out effect
similarly a jewelled
bearing out effect
examples of component
components the exponential
supported by empirical
collect the data
components how long
long it takes
fitting the curve
data it turns
out that exponential
wearing out effect
life time lies
simply this right
rise minus alpha
alpha t right
alpha t minus
minus alpha delta
interval is delta
probability this conditional
delta t right
long the system
equal to capital
expand the right
side so expansion
alpha for delta
powers of delta
higher power terms
terms containing powers
powers of terms
terms like delta
delta t probability
probability of failure
proportional to alpha
immediately you conclude
interval no matter
interval is length
period is proportional
period itself delta
process in fact
lot of components
components behave independently
process is satisfied
arrivals are independent
components will behave
failure is proportional
interval will follow
period being considered
past history right
considered the normal
non exponential failure
exponential failure laws
pass this matter

laws we pass
pass thus matter
important to understand

determine the failure
exponentially failure law
cos c interms
cost of producing
producing an item
talking of exponential
remember the distribution
distribution the failure

cost is small
failure is small

producing that item
assume the cost
earn a profit
