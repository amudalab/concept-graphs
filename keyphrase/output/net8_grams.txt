today is qosqos
qosqos and multimedia
quality of service
service and multimedia
service ? qos
refers to traffic
traffic control mechanisms
mechanisms that seek
differentiate performance based
based on application
application or network
network operator requirements
requirements or provide
predictable or guaranteed
performance to applications
sessions or traffic
aggregates it talks
talks about lot
lot of things
applications which require
require one kind
kind of quality
parameters may sort
kind of qos
set of requirements
traffic is handled
guarantee of performance
performance such things
video and audio
audio conference requires
conference requires bounded
requires bounded delay
delay and loss
rate that means
means the delay
rate of packets
tolerant of losses
sensitive about delays
downloading a file
sensitive to trace
audio streaming means
audio or video
requires a bounded
bounded packet loss
packet loss rate
sensitive to delay
applications like real
real time control
delay is important
valuable called premium
run these premium
ready to pay
expect better guaranteed
data and error
error rate error
rate error rate
packets get lost
stateless and stateful
stateful qos solutions
qos solutions stateless
solutions stateless solution
state about traffic
kind of thing
maintain any states
simply the raw
raw packet forwarding
packet forwarding capacity
kind of delay
delay or performance
stateful solutions routers
solutions routers maintain
routers maintain per-flow
maintain per-flow state
state this flow
important while guaranteeing
audio signal nature
nature is digitized
digitized and packetized
packet switched network
packet in entity
dealt with packets
users are interested
means the flow
flow of packet
streams of packets
audio signals constitute
constitute a flow
purely stateless situation
kind of packet
maintain a state
give powerful services
services like guaranteed
services plus high
high resource utilization
scalable that means
number of flows
router starts increasing
fully stateful system
architecture or isa
architecture for providing
providing qos guarantees
networks for individual
individual application sessions
session of flow
packets it relies
relies on resource
reservation and routers
maintain state information
information of allocated
call setup requests
requests the point
kind of guarantee
guarantee of service
service that means
means its delay
specially reserve resources
resources like buffers
resources like cpu
reserve these resources
give better service
maintain the state
reservations and respond
call setup request
out some resources
session some intermediate
admitted network decides
admit or deny
idea of intserv
call setup phase
ready to provide
provide these resources
protocol called reservation
protocol or rsvp
rsvp rsvp constitutes
constitutes of call
setup and signaling
traffic qos declaration
element admission control
control which means
qos sensitive scheduling
scheduling that means
packet arrives first
scheduled for processing
forwarding this processing
qos sensitive manner
manner similarly routing
similarly routing algorithm
packet discard strategies
intserv qos components
talked about scheduling
discuss about rsvp
rsvp is internet
signaling it creates
creates and maintains
maintains distributed reservation
distributed reservation state
decoupled from routing
routing one thing
routing for setting
setting up paths
multiple trees setup
setup by routing
rsvp multicast tree
tree is setup
routing protocols rsvp
protocols there unlike
atm or telephony
signaling while doing
doing the call
assign the virtual
state that means
means reservation times
out unless refreshed
timed-out and latest
latest paths discovered
discovered through path
tentative resource reservation
reservation and confirmation
simplex and duplex
source would initiate
initiate the setup
send a setup
first switch controller
intermediate nodes send
response and acknowledgement
declare its qos
requirements and characterize
characterize the traffic
specifications r spec
defines the qos
qos being requested
kind of bound
loss is acceptable
reserved that means
queue or buffer
done with scheduling
kind of traffic
spec the intermediate
nodes will compute
compute what kind
kind of resource
required so signaling
protocol is needed
needed to carry
routers where reservation
reservation is required
admission is concerned
routers will admit
admit calls based
manage to give
agreement to pay
service and based
based on current
current resources allocated
specifies the traffic
guarantees of service
element considers unreserved
considers unreserved resources
achieves per-flow bandwidth
bandwidth and delay
first the receiver
means perform per-flow
perform per-flow admission
per-flow admission control
first the path
install per-flow state
sender starts sending
per-flow buffer management
installed and maintained
maintained per-flow state
state for data
data and control
flow the router
lot of work
good at giving
maintain a per-flow
kind of classification
classification and management
difficult to maintain
give it buffers
buffers and queues
robust stateful solutions
stateful solutions provide
provide more powerful
powerful and flexible
make fine grained
short of demarcating
demarcating the flow
setting up atm
atm virtual circuits
done while call
separate reservation protocol
similar to mpls
internet just takes
takes a packet
full power flow
power flow classification
sort of soft
accommodate a number
states by routers
routers in high
high speed networks
networks is difficult
flows so diffserv
diffserv provides reduced
reduced state services
large granular flows
end to end
worlds so diffserv
intends to address
difficulties with intserv
intserv and rsvp
rsvp flexible service
flexible service models
provide more qualitative
qualitative service classes
provide relative service
relative service distinction
distinction like platinum
signaling than rsvp
rsvp many applications
applications and users

protocols namely ftp
ftp and smtp
file transfer protocol
widely used protocol
protocol for reliable
transfer of files
tcp as transport
transport for reliability
out of band
missing one bit
corrupt the entire
degree of reliability
discussion on tcp
achieve this reliability
ftp for downloading
start an ftp
ftp to download
download a file
immediately unlike mail
requirement of ftp
constant the speed
speed should remain
requirement for ftp
ftp a file
network gets congested
ideal transport protocol
protocol for running
general scheme first
contact an ftp
tcp control connection

mentioned the control
mentioned a data
band control means
nodes are communicating
telephone the connection
actual data occupy
occupy two distinct
two distinct channels
communication that means
