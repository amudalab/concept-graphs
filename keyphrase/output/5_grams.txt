mentioned that fiber
dense wavelength division
people are finding
ways of packing
pack those wavelengths
costly a cheaper
cwdm so dense
coarse wavelength division
multiplexing or cwdm
cwdm the channels
number of wavelengths
important multiplexing technique
matter of fact
communication or telecommunication
telecommunication time division
service provider side
signal is accomplished
multiplexing by dividing
medium among users
turn to send
burst of data
data or voice
exclusively time division
two basic forms
synchronous time division
statistical or asynchronous
asynchronous time division
division multiplexing first
slicing this channel
divided ; channel
entire frequency range
turn of channel
sends the first
entire frequency band
division multiplexing system
system like fdm
fdm time division
division multiplexing saves
multiplexing saves money
money by allowing
side this sequence
slot for receiver
synchronous division multiplexing
dividing the cable
cable frequency bands
tdm splits cable
splits cable usage
slots each channel
regular time slot
send a pcm
hierarchy of manner
digital signals discussion
double the rate
converted each sample
bit digital signal
pcm ? pulse
pulse coded modulation
modulation that means
amplitude of voice
bits per sample
rate a number
higher level channel
