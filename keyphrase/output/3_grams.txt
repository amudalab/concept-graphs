recovers the digital
generates new clean
clean analog signal
essentially an analog
computer is digital
make this digital
digital data ride
reaches the telephone
back to digital
encode digital information
amplitude shift keying
two binary numbers
two different amplitudes
amplitudes of carrier
kbps on voice
voice grade lines
transmit digital data
data over optical
signal is analog
signal is supposed
amplitude and high
give this high
low amplitude analog
amplitude analog signal
kind of thing
efficient more common
so-called frequency shift
frequency shift keying
keying in frequency
two different frequencies
two binary digits
susceptible to error
error than amplitude

line the modems
technique called multilevel
signaling each signal
phase or frequency
bit or bits
kind of technique
bits of information
number of times
times the signal
signal will change
rate and bit
encoding of analog
system are nowadays
nowadays entirely digital
in-between in order
advantages of robustness
voice is analog
core telephone system
system is digital
set of codecs
coders and decoders
convert this analog
analog voice signal
kind of digital
system is limited
khz this telephone
first so-called gold
so-called gold quality
high fidelity kind
kind of sound
limit the bandwidth
noticeable so voice
khz of analog
send this analog
back nyquist rate
sample any analog
signal at double
double the maximum
reconstruct the original
original analog signal
khz of signal
khz of bandwidth
points my voice
point my voice
capturing how high
high or low
low the volume
lot we require
samples that makes
kbps please remember
remember this rate
planned their network
places in telecommunications
data is encoded
encoded the simplest
so-called nrz encoding
two different voltage
levels to represent
typically negative voltage
negative voltage equals
positive voltage equals
signal never returns
voltage the value
value during bit
voltage really remains
boundaries of bit
number of transition
kind of scheme
nrzi that means
means non return
voltage during bit
transition from low
low to high
high to low
voltage and negative
constant level signal
interpret the signal
nrz and nrzi
kind of encoding
disadvantages of nrz
ends or starts
drift between timing
timing of transmitter
transmitter and receiver
results in errors
bit phase encoding
transition per bit
clocks can remain
predictable bit transition
manchester and differential
high transition means
low transition means
clock synchronization purposes
period is equal
transition is bit
token ring networks
