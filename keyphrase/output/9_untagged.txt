computer networks prof.sujoy ghosh department of computer science and engineering iit  kharagpur lecture # 9  refer start time  00  47  good day in this lecture we will discuss about  refer slide time  00  54  01  16  sonet the word sonet stands for synchronous optical network  sonet in the usa  canada  and japan  synchronous digital hierarchy elsewhere for example in india we will be calling sdh so this is a time division multiplexing system that transmits a constant stream of information  refer slide time  01  17  02  10  sdh is actually a successor of pdh few years back we used to have a pdh gear in our telecom infrastructure in the wide area network part that is plesiochronous multiplexing  nearly synchronous   this business of being a nearly synchronous introduces us a lot of problems and complications so  when from this nearly synchronous we went to synchronous  that was a major achievement as well as improvement of services as we will see later on in the pdh multiplexing in which two or more signals are transmitted and nominally in the same digital way and the significant instance occur at nominally the same time this was pdh  refer slide time  02  10  2  34  when sonet was introduced  it had a number of achievements to its credit firstly  it is a standard multiplexing using multiples of 51.84 mbps  that is an sts-1 rate and sts-n ? we will look at this rates this was used as building blocks this is something that is to be understood that why it is that particular rate value is so important the point is when you are multiplexing the original source may come from various sources  and these signals will travel  will get together  will separate out and then mixed with others  etc that is possible only when we have in international multiplexing standard and this international multiplexing standard was first achieved in sonet what happened was previously of course the rate which people used were must less and they had all kinds of differences as technology grew and different sort of countries on different things came together  they came together at a certain rate of transmission and this is a basic building block of sonnet there is a standard multiplexing using multiples of this particular day that in itself was a big achievement  refer slide time  03  50  04  23  secondly  it also first stated the optical signal standard for interconnecting multiple vendor equipment the point was previously of course at lower rates they were all electrical signal standards  sonet has both has electrical signal standard as well as optical signal standard and in this optical signal standard it was possible to bring together multiple vendors to agree on to some particular format  refer slide time  04  23  05  23  and the third achievement in sonet was extensive oam & p capabilities so what are oam & p ? o is for operation ; a is for administration ; and m is for maintenance ; p is for protection maintaining the system  administrating the system  operation of the system etc  are much more flexible in sonet when compared to others what kind of flexibility  etc  that we will see regarding protection also  as a matter of fact it is so strong in sonet  that we will specifically discuss this aspect in a separate lecture when we talk about protection these are very strong points in sonet and that ? s not all  refer slide time  05  23  06  50  the fourth one was multiplexing formats for existing digital signals it ? s not that such a development can take place in vacuum ? that means they had some history and the trouble was that different countries have different kinds of histories it is not feasible for a technology to come and say throw away whatever you have been doing and put this there will never be forklift upgrade ; it is never possible because of cost  practical considerations  and all kinds of things so an evolving technology  in order to be successful  has to bring together previous technologies so that they can merge into this new technology and that was another sonet achievement these existing digital signals ? these ds1  ds2  etc  are different multiplexing standards at the low end by the way there is also ds0 and ds0 rate is our venerable 64 kbps line rate do you remember once again that for voice channels  we require a 64 kbps because of pcm  etc we have already discussed so that is a ds0 rate and these several ds0 get together to form ds1 and so on  and that way  there is a hierarchy of rates  refer slide time  06  50  08  25  then the fifth achievement of sonet was that it supports itu hierarchy  e1  etc so this itu hierarchy was more popular in europe  india  etc and they had rates like e1  e2  e3  etc e1 was something like 2 mbps  and then e2 was 1mbps  and e3 was 34 mbps  whereas the development in usa was on a different track they had a tone rate t1  t2  t3  etc their rates were as above  ds1  ds2  etc what happened was that when sonet got introduced  these two sort of came together and although they are not perfectly identical ? these sonet and sdh ? for most of the part  they are identical ; they interoperate with only very slight modification at the boundaries  which is not very important that is a great thing and that means that the same standard is being adopted worldwide  so that any signal can be transported in any way if there is an infrastructure  we can transport in anyway to another part of world ; there is no problem so bringing together of these  that means bridging the atlantic ocean of these two standards  that was another good achievement of sonet  refer slide time  08  25  08  49  the next is that it accommodates other applications the other applications which were not a part of this kind of hierarchy  like bisdn  that is broadband isdn  also can be accommodated in sonet and that way you see sonet was quite flexible ; and how this flexibility is achieved we will see that later on  refer slide time  08  49  09  32  finally it allows quick recovery from failure  talking about protection  etc so if there is a failure like a line failure or if there is a terminal equipment failure you can deploy a sonet in a particular fashion and sonet can recover from this failure and this retransmission  etc  can take place in a short period of time that is very important when you want to give the so-called career great service  where arbitrary down time is absolutely not acceptable as i said  we will discuss this separately in another lecture  refer slide time  09  32  11  02  some of the broad features of sonet and sdh  it was first standardized by anci/ecsa  sdh by itu ? t so sonet was by this anci/ecsa and sdh by this itu ? t sonet is time division multiplexing  pure we know what time division multiplexing is  and we will see later on how frames  etc are made up it is a pure time division multiplexing system sonet encompasses optical and electrical specifications  so there are optical specifications as well as electrical specifications you know that usually at the user end  quite often things start at the electrical level and the rates are low but as you go more towards the backbone of the network  the rates that are needed at the backbone start becoming higher and higher and finally at the real backbone it has to be very high-speed network  and such high-speed networks are only possible through optical communication and optical networking once again  we will see about optical networking in the next couple of lectures our specification  the sonet specification  spans both the electrical side as well as the optical side  and that is a very good feature of sonet  refer slide time  11  02  11  42  sonet uses octet multiplexing  octet means the same thing as a byte that means 8 bits  so sonet uses octet multiplexing they are multiplexed byte by byte sonet uses extremely precise timing  something like in 30 years  maybe ; sonet has very precise timing and that is why things are synchronous and if things become synchronous  then we derive a lot of advantages out of that and sonet provides support for operation  maintenance  and administration  oam  as we have already mentioned  refer slide time  11  42  14  24  sonet is actually superior to t3 and t4  etc with improvements over the t carriers ; these t3  t4 are still in use but they feed into sonet nowadays but earlier  they were used to feed into this pdh and these t3  t4 have particular rates which existed  and their specification left something to be desired because of this lack of synchronicity  handling the signals from different sources is not easy what could happen is that when things are not synchronous  but just almost synchronous  then to handle this ? almost ? part  you have to do something ; you have to incur some overhead ; and you have to incur some complexity that was the difficulty with pdh ; in sdh or sonet  this is eliminated  and we get better transport performance then  we have the ability to identify sub streams this was another advantage of sonet over pdh  which is that a particular user uses may be using a very small kind of bandwidth ? small in relative sense ? and then  as more and more users  as i said as all these data streams or communications streams come towards the backbone of the network  the pipes tend to get fatter that means  we need faster and faster communication so between say two points in the backbone  there may be a very fast communication going on and then after going to some other hops  this will again diverge sonet has this ability that different streams can get together  travel for some time  and then again diverge so the ability to identify sub streams is very important  and that is also allowed in sonet  which was more difficult in the rdr system and of course international connectivity  as i said that it breached atlantic and that was great it enhanced control and administrative function  that was also very good from the point of view of service providers  refer slide time  14  24  16  00  we have talked about this seven-layer osi protocol ; where does a sonet sdh really fit in ? sonet sdh goes to the bottom of this if you remember  starting from the application layer  we go right up to the physical layer there are several layers in osi model  and there are other models anyway  usually the bottom-most layer is always the physical layer so sonet really fits into the physical layer in some sense so what would happen is that the layer just above the physical is the data link layer  may be  or layer two so after all this encapsulation  etc is over through all these six other layers including the data link layer  sonet takes it over for transporting it from one point to another so sdh is placed at the bottom of the protocol stack in the physical layer along with the fiber any ip traffic even if it is the ip traffic of a packet oriented traffic ? and remember that sonet is a tdm system ? it can sort of travel within a sort of tdm transport as they quite often do so any ip traffic that is destined to be transmitted across a fiber-based sdh network will be framed by a layer two protocol before being ready to take its orders from the sdh equipment  refer slide time  16  00  17  59  these are some of the multiplexing standards ? i have not given all of them i just indicate some of them if you remember as i mentioned ds0 is a 64 kbps channel and 24 of them constitute a t1 line so t1 rate is approximately about 1.5 mbps ; 4 t1 gives t2 and 6 t2 gives t3 and so on similarly 30 ds0 ? this is a european system ? gives e1 line so e1  if you remember  is about say 2 mbps  4 e1 gives e2 ; e3 is a 34 mbps line and then i suddenly jump right up to this thing called oc3 ; this o is for optical so this way  this 155 mbps is 3 of the basic sts 1 rates that i mentioned earlier ; i will come to this later on so these are some of the standards there is a whole hierarchy of standards ; for example  this name sdh is also synchronous digital hierarchy  this is a hierarchy for the sonet  the basic rate is sts 1 that is synchronous transport signal level 1  and the speed is 51.84 mbps this is designed to carry what was ds3 rdr or a combination of ds1 ds1 c  and ds2 etc as i said a combination of different streams can flow through a sonet pipe or sonet infrastructure so that is good and that means ds3 is a fat pipe or ds3 is almost the same as sts-1 so it is a fat pipe through which multiple pipes  say may be ds2 or ds1  etc may travel  refer slide time  18  03  18  25  and this net goes up to sts-n  whereas synchronous transport signal level is n ; so this has a speed of n ? 51.84 mbps designed to carry multiple sts -1 i mentioned that these are byte multiplexed sts-1 means 1 byte from one source and another byte from another source and so on  refer slide time  18  25  19  49  fundamental sdh frame is stm -1 ; sdh if you remember is the other standard  which came from europe and they sort of came together and that is what we are talking about sdh frame is stm -1 synchronous transport module and the sonet version is oc -3  that is  optical container  each providing 155 mbps so when we come to this rate this 155 mbps oc 13  different rates etc and different systems  are culminated here  at this 155 mbps  almost 155 stm 4 provides four times the stm -1 capacity  stm 16 provides a further fourfold increase  which means stm4 may be about 620 mbps  and then  if you go to stm16  which is four times that of about 2.5 giga bit/s  then you have stm 64  which is about 10giga bit/s so all these rates are there ; that means  from this point onwards  these two streams have converged and we are going to higher and higher rates in a sort of universal fashion  which makes things easy across the world  refer slide time  19  50  20  17  it is worth noting that the inter networking between sdh and sonet systems is possible at matched bit rates ; for example stm4 and oc12 ; so they interoperate a slight modification to the overhead is required as they are structured little differently so there will always be a little something ; but anyway that is not very serious so they do interoperate  refer slide time  20  17  20  41  we have seen the sonet electrical hierarchy ; now we look at the sonet optical signal hierarchy  oc-1 is the optical career  level 1 ; it carries sts-1 ; oc 3 carries sts-3 or stm -1 at 155 mbps ; oc-n optical career level n  refer slide time  20  41  22  16  oc  n as i mentioned is an optical carrier  which uses n ? 51.84 mbps  so oc  48 is about 2.4 gbps ; overhead percentage is about 3.45 %  oc signal is sent after scrambling to avoid a long string of 0s and 1s to enable clock recovery this is a small technical point ; that means in order to keep the whole thing synchronized  the sdh units use the transitions which happen when there is a 1 so the point is that if there is no 1 for a very long period in the data stream  then the clock on one side may drift relative to the clock on the other side ; that is always possible so we try to avoid long streams of 0s in this sonet or sdh  and we do that by scrambling the data from various streams  etc  or descrambling them the idea is that even if one of them is sending a long stream of 0s  there will be quite a few 1s from the other streams and then the clock will be maintained an sts -n is synchronous transport signal electronic equivalent of optical carriers  refer slide time  22  16  23  29  oc 3  oc12  oc 24 and oc 48 rates are common in telecom circuits ? if you remember oc 48 is 16 times of oc 3 ; that is  16 times 155 mbps  which is about 10 gbps upto 10 gbps is very common these days actually right now  with dwdm systems  oc 192 rate is already in operation  and oc 768  which is 40 gbps  is being talked about so that was another disadvantage earlier that this digital hierarchy of standard rates did not exist beyond a very small rate ? i mean small in today ? s comparison but now we have an extended and open system where  as technology improves  we can always go for higher and higher rates ; so from oc 3  which is 155 mbps  we can go to maybe oc 192  which is 10 gbps or oc 768  which is 40 gbps that we are talking about now  refer slide time  23  29  24  11  how do you use these high-speed links ? these high-speed links of course have to be on fiber ? we can look at details of fiber later on  but please note that in practical application  an sdh line system will have a multiplexer that takes its inputs from a variety of sources in different layer 2 data formats so here we are talking about these different signals coming in the electronic domain  and they are coming from a variety of sources  may be coming with different layer 2 data formats these are aggregated up to form frames at a line rate of system  for example up to stm 64 for a 10 gbps bit rate system  refer slide time  24  11  25  08  now these frames at 10 gbps can not be pumped anywhere it is very difficult to pump it on a copper so these frames are transmitted out onto optical fiber links there is a possibility of multiple sdh multiplexers to each give out one wavelength of a wdm system as we will see later on  this wdm stands for wave length division multiplexing  which is some form of frequency division multiplexing i mentioned about it when i talked about frequency division multiplexing in fiber optics  we talk about wavelength multiplexing so it is possible that one multiplexer is feeding into one wavelength  another multiplexer is feeding into another wavelength  and all these different wavelengths are traveling together in the fiber  refer slide time  25  08  25  44  at the end of the system  there will be an sdh demultiplexer on the other end  just as we have a multiplexer on one side naturally  you have to have a demultiplexer on the other side that now accesses the individual data streams from the stm 64 frames as required so stm 64 is carrying lots of frames in a very short time ; they are sort of separated out and then fed into slower streams down the line so there may also be an sdh add drop multiplexer with the ability to remove and insert lower bit rate streams from the signal  refer slide time  25  44  26  33  alternatively a digital cross connect may be present with the ability to switch individual vc4s well  this is virtual container four  which is another concept  we will talk about later so between different fiber links there is a digital cross connect ; if you have the digital cross connect in the optical level  the advantage is that you need not go into the electronic domain at all so the advantage of not going into electronic domain is that you are handling a huge  very fat  pipe ; that means  a large number of channels  and you can just switch them from one fiber to another fiber simply in the optical domain without doing any kind of processing ; and that is always an advantage  refer slide time  26  33  27  50  we will talk about some sonet terms now ; for example  envelope this envelope is the payload basically  after all encapsulation  etc  you remember that finally near the bottom we have this layer 2 and this layer 2 protocol will encapsulate it and then hand it over to sonet at the lower level  maybe at the physical level so whatever this layer 2 hands over to sonet is the payload ; the rest of it are kind of system overheads ? payload plus some end system overhead also goes into this payload so these together form what is known as the envelope ; this is a sonet term other bits and bytes which are used for management  that means oam and p portion  goes as the overhead of sonet then there is the concept of concatenation ; that means  unchannelized envelope can carry super rate data payload  for example  atm  etc so  the method of concatenation is different from that of t carrier hierarchy ; we need not bother about it at the moment  refer slide time  27  50  28  23  then there are some nonstandard functional names in sonet  like tm is for terminal multiplexer  also known as line terminating equipment or lte these are ends of point-to-point links adm is for add drop multiplexer ; we have mentioned this dcc is for digital cross connect wideband and broadband ; mn is for matched nodes and d + r means drop and repeat  etc anyway  these are just some terms  refer slide time  28  23  28  40  now let us come to some important concepts in sonet namely  section  line  and path what is a section ? i will just show you figure first and then come back to this  refer slide time  28  40  30  24  please look at this figure  we have some multiplexers so as the figure shows  we have a multiplexer in this side  another is an output that fits to another multiplexer this multiplexer is going in this direction and after some time  the signal becomes weak so we want a repeater ; what is a repeater ? a repeater is something which boosts the signal strength so there is a repeater  then it travels some more distance then there is a repeater again and then it travels some more distance and then on other side we have the corresponding demultiplexer and then it fits into the other de-multiplexer from repeater to repeater  we call it a section so from repeater to multiplexer  this is also a section so multiplexer to repeater  repeater to repeater  these are called sections and then  from multiplexer to multiplexer  we call it a line at the repeater  nothing happens excepting the signal is cleaned up the signal may be boosted or there may be other cleaning operation  synchronizing operation  etc  that may be done at the repeater ; but as such  the signals which are traveling here  the same set of signals are traveling here at the multiplexer  of course  some of the signals may go off in another direction ; some signals may go in some other direction  etc so at the multiplexer  there may be a convergence or divergence  depending on which way the signal is flowing that may happen at the multiplexer  so from multiplexer to multiplexer  we call it a line ; and then from the end user point to end user point  we call it a path  refer slide time  30  30  30  57  look at this once ; the portion from a multiplexer to a repeater is known as a section or it could be a repeater to a repeater also ; the portion from a multiplexer to another multiplexer is a line the portion from source to destination multiplexer is a path ; below path line and section is the photonic sub layer ; that means photonic sub layer is whatever is happening in the optical domain  and we are not discussing that at the moment  refer slide time  30  57  31  14  sections are bounded by repeaters or multiplexers that terminate the line ; lines may carry several tributary signals and are bounded by multiplexers  a path goes end to end between terminating multiplexers  refer slide time  31  15  33  49  each sth frame lasts 125 microseconds as i mentioned  this 125 microseconds time period  time epoch  is sort of sacred in this whole domain because 125 microseconds is what is required for a ds0 channel remember this is a time division multiplexing  which means that if you have a 125 microsecond kind of slot  then some of the ds0 bytes can take these bytes actually if you have to take it as 8 kbps and if it is 8 kbps  inverse of that is 125 microsecond so if you have a 125 microsecond slot  if 1 byte travels in this frame  then that is enough for 1 ds0 channel in sonet we have very very sophisticated and very fast equipment ; that means this is a time division multiplexing system ; within this 125 microseconds  not only 1 byte can go but lot of other bytes can go that means a lot of channels can travel together in this 125 microseconds frame this is the idea so each sth frame lasts 125 microseconds ; how many bytes are going in there depends on whether it is sts -1 or sts -2 or sts ? n  etc so 125 microsecond as i mentioned is 8000 frames/s sts -1 frame has 6480 bits or 810 bytes that means in one  125 microsecond slot or frame  we are putting in 810 bytes theoretically  of course  that means it can carry 810 ds0 or voice signals ; actually it is not 810  it is lesser than that because a number of these bytes are used for different types of overheads we will talk about this we have these 810 bytes  the octets are understood in terms of a table of 9 rows and 90 columns ; so let us look at this figure  refer slide time  33  49  36  16  we have a sonet frame or an sdh frame  which has 9 rows  you can see the 9 rows on this side and then 90 columns  total 90 columns out of these 90 columns  3 columns have been shown in yellow these are sort of used for overhead and these 87 columns are used for payload or for envelope if you remember  the envelope contains the payload as well as little bit of overhead  which we will come to later on this is how after every 90 bytes  we come back to again another 3 bytes of this overhead this is how it is to be understood  the first 3 columns contain transport overhead and toh has 9 rows by 3 columns  that means 27 bytes  which is subdivided into section overhead soh  section overhead   9 bytes  3 rows of 3 columns ; loh  that is  line overhead  which is 18 bytes  that is  6 rows of 3 columns so we have section overhead and we have a line overhead ? remember we have these three concepts like section  line  and path we have not talked about path overhead there is some path overhead and it goes into the envelope ; so there is some path and as far as these things as line and section are concerned  these are the overhead bytes just to clarify why do we require the over bytes ? the point is that the multiplexers or the repeaters have to have some communication between them in the control plain so as to give you this oam capability for that some information needs to be sent or exchanged between the two points ; anywhere there is a section  the section overhead would consider those things which are central to the section about the signal strength and other kind of things ; line overhead maybe would contain something else and similarly path overhead would contain something else but these are required for these oam capabilities that we have in sonet  refer slide time  36  16  36  49  let us look at these overheads separately ; first section overhead  which defines and identifies frames and monitors section errors and communication between section terminating equipment so these are its functions  it identifies frames ; monitors section errors ? if there are errors  it monitors section errors ; and communication between section terminating equipment  maybe two repeaters or a repeater and multiplexer  and so on  refer slide time  36  49  37  29  line overhead locates first octet of spe and monitors line errors and communication between terminating equipment we will come back to this locating of the first octet of spe this is a very interesting feature and we will talk about this separately previously we talking about section errors ; so line errors and communication between terminating equipment  etc  is taken care of by the line overhead apart from that  line overhead contains this pointer  really  which points to the first byte of the spe  refer slide time  37  29  38  36  and then there is a path overhead ; and as i said path overhead is really inside the envelope and we will look at all these later path overhead verifies connection path ; you remember path means from end to end ; that means from the end to end multiplexer is a path whether the connection has been established or not  it monitors path errors  receivers ? status  communication between path termination equipment  and so on this is the poh  we talked about the synchronous payload envelope or spe that i was talking about that is  the other 87 columns hold the spe  synchronous payload envelope   so spe has 9 waves by 87 columns  which are divided into path overhead and payload  which means the path overhead goes along with the envelope that is in the spe  whereas other overheads have separate bytes or separate columns associated with them as shown  refer slide time  38  36  39  52  now this spe does not necessarily start in the column 4  which means that the spe does not necessarily stay within one frame ; these are two very important points in sonet the point is that although you have these 87 columns  actually the data may start getting transmitted at some arbitrary points inside those 87 columns what is the idea ? i mean why do you want to leave something and then only start from the middle ? the point is that if there are some kind of mismatches of late  etc  if everything in the world were absolutely synchronous  all activities and all equipments  etc  then you could have started from the beginning but that is not the case and this is where we absorb this kind of variation and this gives great flexibility to sonet  which was not there earlier and the other interesting thing is that the spe does not necessarily stay within one frame  which means that the spe may start in one frame and then end in another we will just look at a diagram of this ; let us have a diagram of this you see  refer slide time  40  00  40  21  the spe in light green color ; it really starts from somewhere i mean somewhere after leaving some of the rows  it starts here  and the path overhead is somewhere here  and there are two frames here so spe is really spanning both the frames  refer slide time  40  25  40  57  spe is not frame aligned ; it overlaps multiple frames ; avoids buffer management complexity and artificial delays whenever there is something to send  you can just send it in the envelope ; just put that pointer to that yellow edge  so that yellow edge will point to the first byte of the spe it allows direct access to byte synchronous lower level signals  for example  ds1  with just one frame recovery procedure  refer slide time  40  5 7  41  33  these are the advantages of the sonet frames this is one frame coming in may be 125 microseconds ; this is the next frame ; and spe  as i have already shown  can overlap i mean it may start somewhere within the first frame and then continue in the second frame in this fashion and then be over here actually after this  some other envelope may come in over here  refer slide time  41  35  42  34  now of course where is the path overhead ? there are two fields  h1 and h2 in loh ; loh means line overhead  which points to the beginning of the path overhead path overhead beginning floats within the frame ; 9 bytes that is one column may span frame along with the spe ; it is originated and terminated by all path devices ; and this gives you end-to-end support these are the features of path overhead the point is that if you remember the path is end to end  that means it is close to the end users ; just as the end user may start somewhere arbitrarily in-between  a path overhead also goes along with the spe and it starts over there and at loh  we keep a pointer to this path overhead  refer slide time  42  40  44  17  just as some of the equipment that we use in sonet  one of the most important of these is the add drop multiplexer they are important because at certain point in the network  what might happen is that there are some sources which want to send into the network they will sort of go so there is this sonet equipment  which is adm let us say  and sonet stream is flowing let us say like this there may be something that wants to upload and travel along with this thing at the same time  this may be the destination location for some of the other signals which originated elsewhere ; they have to be dropped here so some signals have to be dropped  some signals have to be added so this multiplexer can handle that and that is very important that is why they are called add drop multiplexers this stream is itself of course flowing at a tremendous rate  whatever that rate is so sonet sdh is a synchronous system with the master clock accuracy of 1 in 109  which you will see is highly accurate it shows when you come in some kind of ccm clock somewhere and then there is a protocol for distributing and maintaining this clock over the entire network frames are sent byte by byte and adms can add drop smaller tributaries into the main sonet sdh stream and i have explained how that is done within that frame you can send lot of bytes ; you can take out some of the bytes and add some of the bytes that is how you take out some of the smaller tributaries and add some of the smaller tributaries  refer slide time  44  22  44  58  digital cross connect  which is an optical layer equipment  is also very important it cross connects thousands of streams and software control  so it replaces patch panel ; that is a good thing about the digital cross connect and a software control is coming where the control is coming from the control plane of the switches you can connect the streams from may be one fiber to another ; it handles performance monitoring  pdh sonet streams  and also provides adm functions ; that means add drop multiplexing functions  refer slide time  44  58  45  47  finally we have this concept of grooming in sonet grooming means  we group the traffic in some format so you want to keep this group in one particular way ; it could be that there is a one group of streams for whom you want to give higher priority or you want to give higher quality of service so you have to group them together similarly there may be multiple groups ; so it enables grouping traffic with similar destination  qos  etc  which is a part of grooming it enables multiplexing or extracting streams also ? that is also part of grooming narrow wider broadband and optical cross connects may be used for grooming  refer slide time  45  47  46  40  if you look at this figure  you have this narrow band  this sonet layer and optical layer in the narrow band  we have this ds0 grooming and then in the ds1 grooming  there is a white band and then the broadband ds3 grooming ? so the rates are going up  starting from the 64 kbps  it is going up when you are going up for the sts 48  you are in optical domain ; that means sts 48 is stm 16  so that is a high rate the point is that  at that rate  most probably  you are well in the optical domain then  finally  you can go to all optical domain ; that means wavelength  waveband  and fiber grooming ? there are different levels of grooming  depending on what you want to do  refer slide time  46  42  48  00  lastly we will just talk a little bit about virtual tributaries or containers we have already talked a little bit about it this is the opposite of stm ; actually in some sense this is called sub multiplexing ; that is  different streams coming together to form one very fat or very fast stream this is the other thing ? how do we  sort of  differentiate these sub streams within this  which has to do with sub multiplexing ? sts -1 is divided into 7 virtual tributary groups  sdh uses the term virtual containers or vcs we talked about vcs  we just mentioned what are called vts or virtual tributaries in sonet lingo so we have 7 virtual tributaries  12 columns each  which can be subdivided further you see that there are 12 columns each  with 7 virtual tributary groups ? we have got 84 columns and these 84 columns are out of the 87 you have in sts -1  refer slide time  48  01  50  00  vt groups are byte interleaved to create a basic sonet spe so this vt groups are byte interleaved they may be again extracted from each other vt 1.5 is the most popular  quickly accessed  t1 line within the sts-1 frame so the idea is that you have a t1 line  which is approximately 1.5 mbps line  which is coming out of your small business  and you have a 1.5 mbps line so that is your bandwidth requirement  you want to connect it to a distant location somewhere and you do not want your thing to get mixed up with others at the same time  as a small business you can not have infrastructure of connecting to another location which is wide apart so you will go with this public infrastructure or public switched tele psdn network or whoever is maintaining this communication equipment usually telecom people maintain it in most of the places anyway  they have a sort of fiber going from one place to another  which contains very high-speed links what you want is your t1 line should join them  sort of get transported over the distance and then go and feed into another t1 line at the destination that is what you want you want your t1 line to sort of have a separate sort of existence ? just like in a compartment  we have different passengers passengers have their own individual entity but together they are packed into one compartment and then they travel similarly your t1 line is going to ride onto to this very fast stream and travel to the destination so vt 1.5 gives your t1 line  refer slide time  50  00  51  16  how do you find out about the difference ? how do you separate them in the sp ? the point is  you require one more level of pointer used to access it you can access a t1 with just a 2-pointer operation  first from the loh ? you remember  you go to the sp  just like that similarly  you go to the different tributaries or different containers using just one more level of pointer this flexibility was not there earlier ; so it was very complex to do the same function in ds3 for example  accessing ds0 within ds3 requires full demultiplexing  stacked multiplexing  etc so you require full demultiplexing ; that is not required in sonet the point is that the other streams may go ; you know where in that frame your bytes really are traveling for the stream or for the container or for the tributary that you are interested ; you just extract it  others keep on traveling as they are so you do not demultiplex the whole thing and that gives a great advantage of add drop multiplexing  refer slide time  51  16  52  02  this is just a figure showing that you can have various types of lines  all feeding into the same infrastructure you may have what we have put over here  ds1  which is 1.544 mbps  e1  2.048 mbps  dsic ds2  ds3  atm .48.384  e4  which is 139.264 mbps  atm is about 150 mbps  etc they are sort of traveling ; they are getting in different containers from vt 1.5  different tributaries  that is 1 5236 etc  form a vt group and ride on a higher strength or higher speed stream  refer slide time  52  02  53  55  just as i said  these are sort of identified through a pointer ; so we have this transport overhead we use some bytes for that out of those 87 columns we have so we use some columns of that and then we put a pointer  which gives to the sts payload pointer then there is a vt pointer  virtual tributary pointer  and this much is the vt spe within the overall sts-1 spe  which is the payload even now sonet is the most widely used technology in wide area networking that is existing today of course  as you know  as technology grows  may be we will go out of sonet people are already talking about going out of sonet because one disadvantage of sonet is that its equipment tends to be expensive well  expensive compared to what we think today what is cheap today and what we think is cheap today may sound very expensive tomorrow ; that is how the technology grows so people are talking about direct transport over the optical layer  etc may be we will touch those aspects later on but all that is still in a sort of experimental stage and on the field  actually  sdh or sonet equipment is almost everywhere ; all types of telephone companies are connected through that and major service providers use this as a means of transport thank you  refer slide time  53  58  54  11  good day,so today we will be speaking about fiber optic components  refer slide time  54  11  55  22  and fiber optic communication as might of heard this lecture as well as the next couple of lectures  we will concentrate on fiber optic components we have looked at some of the physical layer components of fiber optic systems before so we will sort of quickly review that  some of the stuff we will be talking about today is going to be common and then from that point we will take out take it up into wdm systems  how wavelength division multiplexing is done and how systems are handled in fiber optic domain  this fiber optic domain happens to be very crucial because a lot of traffic in terms of volume may be as much as forty to fifty percent  actually goes through the fiber as days are going by and as more and more demand for bandwidth is coming up fiber optics is becoming more and more important  we will be talking about fiber optic components today  refer slide time  55  22  55  56  in fiber optic component of course the basic fiber is there we have already talked about it  so we will talk little bit more about this then we have light source and receivers on two end because we know that in fiber optic cables light is the carrier of information then we require these different components like amplifiers  couplers  modulator  multiplexer and switches so we will look up at these components one by one and then we will start our discussion on wavelength division multiplexing  refer slide time  55  56  56  42  the next set of components are multiplexers filters gratings  just talk little bit about it ,if you look at this wavelength  these are all ; wavelength selective  devices multiplexers  filters  these are wavelength selective devices in a wavelength filter and what we want is suppose ? 1  ? 2 etc so many are coming  i want only ? 1 out 2 ? 3 ? 4 etc are absorbed or something where as if you are a multiplexer i want the difference this ? coming in different lines  i want all to be mixed together and use the same line  these are wavelength multiplexer  refer slide time  56  42  58  07  so application could be particular wavelength or a particular wave band selection wave band is nothing but some contiguous operating wavelengths which all are side by side  if you remember that in the operating window what ever be that 1550 what ever may be the window you are using there you can have a number of ? all side by side  there is a guard band between each of these operating ? so where the guard band that is given by the i q t has specified  how much guard band etc you have to have but so you can have large number of ? all group together in the same window aband out of that means a bunch of sequence is out of that you can short select instead of selecting only  that is wavelength band selection static wavelength cross connects and oam is optical add drop multiplexers  you have come across this term optical add drop multiplexers in the context of sonet but optical domain we require optical add drop multiplexers  we will come to that equalization of gain so that is another application filtering of noise ideas used in laser operation and dispersion compensation modules etc  these are the different applications  refer slide time  58  08  58  15  one of the standard wavelength selective component is arrayed waveguide gratings ,we have seen this before ?
