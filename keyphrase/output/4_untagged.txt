computer networks prof .sujoy ghosh dept of computer science & engineering i.i.t  kharagpur lecture no # 4 physical medium  ii  refer start time  0  45  good day today we will have the second lecture on the physical medium ; in the last lecture we have seen the different ways these digital signals and analog signals  etc can be used for communication  and how digital data or analog data can be encoded well  we are mostly interested in the digital form of data  how they can be encoded etc  and some of the general impairments of physical medium in this lecture we are going to look at specific media  which are used in networking  refer slide time  01  33 ? 01  34  refer slide time  01  34 ? 02  43  there are basically two types of media  which are used for communication  one is cable they are actually two classes of cable now this cable could be copper cable or could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair the twisted pairs are actually unshielded twisted pairs or utp sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common ; there are shielded twisted pairs also then  one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic these are the different types of cables that we use in networks similarly  we can also communicate without the use of any cable  by simple electromagnetic radiation and this radiation could be in different ranges of frequencies  like infrared or microwave or radio or satellite  etc we will look at all these one by one  refer slide time  02  44 ? 05  09  first let us look at the kind of media that we use in a lan lan  as you remember  is a local area network that could vary from  let us say  1 m to 1 km so it is local strictly by its size ; 1 m means two computers connected on the same table or connected side by side ; it could be all the computers in one building and all the computers in several buildings ; and so on that is the kind of range that we have for lan the medium that we use for lan could be coaxial cables  utp  fibers  and wireless most of the types of cables that we talked about find their way in some niche or other in local area networks and  of course  utp or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories we could have cat 3 cable  cat 5 cable  cat 5e cable  cat 6 cable  cat 7 cable and so on.you must have seen cat 3 cable ? if you have looked in your telephones that is the landline phones  they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of category 3 for computer networking  cat 3 cables could also be used for lan  although we usually prefer cat 5 onwards the kind of things that are on the network could be pbx ; pbx is local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports  etc ethernet is one technology  which is used in lan ; atm is also used ; fddi is sometimes used fddi if you remember is fiber distributed  that is  the fddi ring kind of structure we have network boxes like hubs  switches  routers  etc so these are the terms you would come across of course we would talk about some of these in more detail later on  but these are some of the technologies that come into lan or local area networks  refer slide time  05  09 ? 07  22  then we come to slightly bigger networks  called man or metropolitan area networks there are some networks which are even smaller than a lan ; they are called personal area networks i may be wearing three or four computers and they are connected in network on my body so we will come to pan later on going on the other side of the spectrum  that means  from lan to bigger network  which is man  a metropolitan area network  typically one campus or one city may be several small towns  which are close together they would come under the purview of a man man is a ballpark figure ; it would extend may be about 10 kilometers ? so it could be 5 kilometers  or it could be 20 kilometers or something in that range the kind of medium that we use for metropolitan area networks is coaxial cables  both base band and broadband ; we will come to what they are sometimes utp are used but that is not a very preferred way of connecting one way where utp is definitely used is when you try to network through telephone lines utp could be a hybrid kind of system wherein some part of it could be coaxial and some part of it could be utp and some part of it could be fiber fiber means fiber optic cables the kind of technology that goes into a man would be pbx  different kinds of modems  for example if you are using a broadband coaxial cable you might use something that is known as a cable modem then you have this long-reach ethernet that means ethernet over may be some lines  cable tv dsl digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless one issue which is important in man is the issue of access that means how do you reach to each individual user ? think of it as a town or a city ; you really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost if it is a small building like in a lan you can take utp cable to his room there are problems of taking utp cables to each individual house ; there could be electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost so if you are trying to build so much copper into it that is quite costly so to access users who are distributed over a somewhat wide area of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks  refer slide time  08  32 ? 10  08  finally  at the extreme of the spectrum  we have wan  wide area network so they may stretch from 10 kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers or almost to the other side of the globe they involve very very long distances the medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology used in wan is sonet or sdh it ? s almost similar technology atm  ip ? that is the internet protocol ? dwdm  dense wavelength division multiplexing  geo and leo geo stands for geostationary satellite and leo is low art orbiting satellite so these are the kind of technologies that go into wan one issue in man is of course always cost and bandwidth  wan bandwidth because as you can imagine that when you have to take some message across hundreds of thousands of kilometers away there is a lot of cost involved in it so wan bandwidth is usually costly and we try to make the maximum use of this bandwidth of course in recent times lot of fiber has been laid internationally so the bandwidth problem is becoming less and less  but even then wan bandwidth remains costly  refer slide time  10  08 ? 12  43  now let us see some of the cable specifications that we use  first we take up this utp cable of category 5 so cat 5 utp cables specification says about 100 mhz and these can stretch up to 100 meters these are the figures which are normal  you can stretch things little bit this way or that way at times depending on your operating circumstances  etc but this is normally the figure ; so you can have some kind of idea from these the cat 5 cable looks like your standard telephone cable ; the only thing is that they are made to a slightly better specification the connector at the end of a cat 5 cable has got a specific scientific number ; this is called rj 45 so we use rj 45 connectors for connecting cat 5 cables there is a standard ansi or tia or eia standard for how cat 5 cable is to be used what are the standard ways and how they are twisted  etc there are a number of wires inside the twisted pair of cables ; so which wire stands for what  etc i simply refer to the name of the standard here  which is eia 568 a and then a cable has to be tested according to some standards ; tsb 6795 is the standard for testing cables cat 5 cable is usually under these circumstances 100 mhz to say 100 meters if you are within the 100 meters  if you have done everything properly it is expected that it can work up to 100 mbps the point is that if the distance is much less than that then naturally the same cable can work at a much higher speed so inside the same room the cat 5 cable may be used for 1000 mbps connection between computers or network nodes  refer slide time  12  43 ? 13  26  there is some enhanced version of cat 5 cable ; i will not go into the details of this  which are given over here the specifications are almost the same ; only thing is that this is slightly better in some way and it can work for 1000 base tx for small distance i said within a room if you are using cat 5 e cable instead of simple cat 5  you may be able to operate at 1000 mbps without much of a difficulty  refer slide time  13  27 ? 15  24  then we have the cat 6 cables  which is again slightly higher than cat 5 cables here  the specification is 250 mhz this specification is much higher ; so naturally cat 6 cable would be somewhat costlier than cat 5 or cat 5 e cables the same kind of connector is actually the recommended cable for operating at 1000 mbps so here is a point when networking started  people thought that 10 mbps is a fairly high speed and soon people were using networks a lot and 10 mbps was not enough  so people went to 100 mbps now people are saying that 100 mbps is slow ; so we want to go to 1000 mbps you see that in a comparatively short period of time  may be 15 ? 20 years  our demand for bandwidth has grown a thousand-fold when you are planning for an infrastructure  say copper infrastructure  in any organization or somewhere  then you should keep this in mind that whatever specification people are giving you today  after some time people may want to upgrade what i mean to say is that if you put in cat 6 kind of cables and use it for only 800 mbps today  then 1 or 2 years later you can use the same cable for 1000 mbps saving a lot of cost at that time ; but of course  that would mean a higher upfront cost today so that is always there  refer slide time  15  25 -16  44  so for testing these kind of cables there are all kinds of testing parameters i will not go to the details of these at all this is a rather technical part return loss is a measure of the reflected energy caused by impedance mismatch in the cabling system when you put a cabling system you can test it and one of the things you might test for is return loss and another thing you might test is a cross talk as reflected from the other end elfext is defined as the measure of signal coupling from a transmitter at the near end into a neighboring pair measured at the far end  relative to the received signal level on the same pair these kinds of testing parameters are there for testing copper cables similarly if we have put fiber optic cable somewhere  then fiber optic cables would have some other testing parameters it ? s a good idea to test the passive networking infrastructure  meaning all these cables and connections etc  and how they perform  refer slide time  16  45 ? 18  23  now from unshielded twisted pair cables  we go to the base band coaxial cables we have already mentioned about the base band coaxial cables these are the cables we were talking about when we talked about the bus topology if you remember ; so it is basically a shielded cable there is a copper cord surrounded by an insulating material  which is surrounded by braided outer conductor  which is surrounded again by a protective outer covering so this is considerably thicker than a utp and then in the coaxial cables also there are two varieties  the so-called thick coaxial cable and thin coaxial cable this technology is becoming obsolete now  but just for our knowledge  a thick coaxial cable is also presented as 10base5 this 10 represents that it works at 10 mbps and 5 represents that it can go up to 500 hundred meters the thin coaxial cable is 10base2  so it works at 10 mbps and goes up to 200 meters as i told you  nowadays almost everybody wants a 100 mbps to their desktop  in which case this thick and thin coaxial cables  that is the base band coaxial cables  are no longer of much use today  refer slide time  18  23 ? 20  57  but another type of coaxial cable  which is very much in vogue and which is used even today  is the kind of cable that your cable operator puts many of you have seen that cable operator puts some kind of coaxial cable into your room  which goes into your tv now it is possible to use the same infrastructure for computer communications also  i.e  computer networking also remember  i told you while discussing man that one of the most important issues in metropolitan area network is the issue of access ; that is  how do you reach each individual subscriber at his or her home ? this cable operator has reached lot of homes anyway so naturally  people started thinking whether we can use these cables from the cable operators for network communication  and special kinds of modems were designed for that called cable modem so we have a broadband cable infrastructure rather than the base band that we were talking about this is quite often used and now they are being deployed in many cities for computer communication this is  as i said  analog signal carrying tv signals and has been used for carrying data traffic older cables carry up to 450 mhz and the newer cables that have been put can go to higher frequencies  that means  higher bandwidth  and these cables use amplifiers at regular intervals now these amplifiers in the old days were only one-way amplifiers because the way the cable operators wanted it is that they are broadcasting their signal from some central location and it just has to reach people ? s tv but when you want to use this for computer communication the communication has to be two-way so the amplifier also has to be a two-way amplifier so such small technicalities are there ; it requires an amplifier at regular intervals and is a shared medium usually this medium is shared  that means  you and your neighbors ? all your data is in the same medium  refer slide time  20  57 ? 22  27  as i said  for carrying data  two-way amplification is necessary dual cable systems are like two trees  both rooted at the head-end ; the head-end is where all the service providers ? equipments etc are placed so there are all kinds of split systems  they use 5 to 30 mhz for inbound traffic and the rest for outbound traffic ; mid-split system and there are all kinds of systems for using this for data communication by the way  there is also some asymmetry that people have found in the network traffic for an average user in a city one of the most popular uses of computer network nowadays is just going onto the internet  may be surfing it  may be getting some information  etc but the amount of traffic in terms of query etc  which flows from the user to the computer  wherever it may be  is relatively small whereas you may be downloading large files  images  may be even songs  movies etc your bandwidth requirement ? the upstream bandwidth requirement and the downstream bandwidth requirement are usually not the same ; there is an asymmetry  refer slide time  22  27 ? 24  03  now we come to another very important kind of cable  having looked at copper cable  namely  optical fibers optical fiber basically is made of glass  very pure and very transparent silica glass is used  which is very very transparent in the sense that it can go up to tens of kilometers without too much of attenuation on the way so think of a glass slab  which is several kilometers thick and you can see through it quiet easily  so that kind of transparency is required so  naturally  there have to be some very strict standards for making this glass but after all  it is simply a glass  which is drawn into fiber for giving us this optical fiber at moderate dimensions  light is restricted to the fiber because of total internal reflection for ordinary light ; this is called a multimode fiber at still smaller dimensions  say something like 8 to 10 nanometers  the fiber acts like a wave guide for lasers this is known as a single-mode fiber multimode fibers are used for local area networks whereas in all wide area networks and even in local area networks these days single-mode fibres are more preferred for carrying signals  refer slide time  24  03 ? 26  55  finally what is optical networking ? one thing is  naturally  optical transmission by the way  optical transmission could be fibers or free space free space means suppose you direct a laser from the source to the destination on the free space  light will travel straight or it is expected at least to travel straight and then reach the receiver so you do not need any fiber or anything at all but there is a problem the first obvious problem is that the sender and the receiver have to be on the same line of sight without any hindrance in-between  that is one point and then there are other complications  which might come ; in the sense that the intervening air may get hot and its refractive index may change so the light may actually bend  like they do in a mirage in a desert that kind of things may happen  so it might miss the receiver altogether so free space optic communication is not very much preferred people prefer to put fiber optic cables wherever they can these cables or free space we are talking about is for fiber optic transmission then there is the question of optical switching ; can we provide the network level functionalities in the optical domain itself ? this is a topic of research these days as this is quite promising so maybe we will just look at this later on finally  why optics ? the point is that optical fiber capacity is huge  very huge ? you see 50 terabits per second is mentioned over here the point is that this has got an absolutely fantastic bandwidth  so if you can put a fiber optic connection between two endpoints your present as well as foreseable future requirements will surely be met so that is one good thing about optics the other very good thing about optics is that it is immune to electromagnetic interference  if there is a lightning strike nearby  then it is not going to affect this very thin strand of glass that we have put  which is very good because if the same thing happened to a copper cable  there would be a surge and it could maybe burn some of your equipment so this is another reason people favor fiber optics a lot  refer slide time  26  55 ? 29  27  now the point is that this 50 terabits per second bandwidth that we were talking about is only theoretical actually sometimes  i have been asked what the bandwidth of this fiber optic cable is ? this really does not make much sense because the bandwidth of any fiber optic cable you would find would ultimately be dictated by the kind of boxes that you connect to it the limitations would be there ; the limitation is not inherent in the fiber fiber can take up a huge bandwidth as i just mentioned  but at the two ends you will have some optics and then you will have some electronics now electronics can not work at that kind of speed a single piece of electronics suddenly can not work at that kind of speed ; so the overall speed at the bandwidth that you can get out of this fiber would depend on the kind of electronics that you put at the two ends that is why there is a lot of interest these days in whether some of these electronics can be replaced by optics so that we can get much higher bandwidth now not content with just sending data through only one wavelength through this fiber  we have what is known as wavelength division multiplexing that means different wavelengths of light carry different signals through the same fiber optic channel ; that is called multiplexing we will come to wdm later on with this wdm  you can get higher kind of bandwidth lucent  for example  demonstrated 64 lambda ; that means  64 different wavelengths into 40 gbps that is each of them operating at 40 gigabits per second over a distance of 4000 kilometers  so i think that is really great there are two kinds of wavelength division multiplexing  namely  coarse wavelength division multiplexing  which is somewhat cheaper  and dense wavelength division multiplexing  which is used in wan but is much more costly sothe number of wavelengths that we can use today varies from may be 8 or 12 to may be 64 or so people are working on this ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing  which can carry us to may be 100 wavelengths in the same fiber  refer slide time  29  27 ? 31  02  for a quick history  in 1958 laser was discovered then in the mid-60s guided wave optics was demonstrated  in 1970  we saw the production of low loss fibers because we want this low loss  we will be talking about this loss presently after sometime so this made long-distance optical transmission possible there was the invention of semi conductor laser diode  which was important then in 70s to 80s we used fiber in telephony in the form of sonet or sdh do not bother about what they are right now ; we will be talking about them later on in mid-80s  lans and man were sort of being put in place and in late 80s  we had a breakthrough in optically amplifying optical signals so there is edfa and rbm  dot fiber amplifier ? we will be talking about that too in this lecture itself ; and then in mid to late 90s  this dense wavelength division multiplexing system started being put and in late 90s and in 21st century optical switching systems  different components of optical switching systems are been developed all the time the point is that fiber optics has such a tremendous potential that there was a lot of interest in this and there is a lot of work going on in this area at the moment  refer slide time  31  02 ? 32  17  so here is some kind of a picture of a cross-section of a fiber optic cable as you can see  when you see a fiber optic cable  you will see this fad jacket  which is just a productive jacket made of plastic  rubber ; then inside it  there will be glass fiber but what you see is actually not the fiber ; that is also actually a cladding but that is made of glass inside this cladding there is this very fine core  which actually carries the signal in one fiber optic cable like this  you will have several such individual fibers so these are all individual fibers what has been shown over here are the individual fibers and each of them will carry one ; i have shown only 3 over here but it is typical to have something like 4 cores  8 cores  24 cores  120 cores in one cable  refer slide time  32  17 ? 34  02  let us look at this diagram of how it is so if you take a cross section  there is cladding on two sides and core in-between if you sort of cut it side ways  this is the kind of picture you get and what happens is that once the light comes into the core it sort of refracts like this and it impinges on this wall at a very wide angle of incidence there is a difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding that is always maintained so the point is that the core is at the higher refractive index and the cladding at lower refractive index there is total internal reflection over here  so even if the fiber bends a little bit ? although light usually would travel straight but through this total internal reflection it would follow this fiber ? it can take small bends and come out of the other side of the fiber but of course there are limitations to how much you can bend first of all  if you bend this core too sharply  this core will get damaged so there are limitations on what is your bending radius  radius of curvature  etc but in general to this total internal reflection the light will follow this core so this is another picture ? light is input from one end so this sort of follows the fiber and gets out of the other end  refer slide time  34  02 ? 35  02  well the light gets out  but how do you get it into something ? that means  how do you connect these fiber cables  which are actually glass fibers  how do you connect them to other things ? there are two ways of termination ; we can terminate a fiber by plugging it into a fiber socket and then sort of clamping them together we can splice them mechanically by putting the two cut ends into a sleeve and clamping them or we can fuse them to form a solid  which is a better method of connecting fibers even when you fuse them what will happen is there will be some kind of disturbance ? that glass material will not be totally homogenous at the junction so there will still be some loss but this loss is quite low if you are very careful in this splicing  referred slide time  35  02 ? 35  27  and what about light sources ? we have two different light sources ; they are called semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes naturally  the first one gives out lasers whereas the other one  the simple leds  give non-coherent lights so they are simple leds both have their advantages and disadvantages  refer slide time  35  27 ? 37  19  when you are using the semi-conductor laser ? laser as you know is coherent light and simple led gives you non-coherent light ? so the data rate for lasers can be much higher with lasers and this is low fiber type you can use multimode fibers over here and you can use single mode fibers we prefer single mode fibres for lasers the distance that an led can cover is short whereas the distance that single mode fibers  that means lasers  can travel through a single mode fiber is really long so all our long-distance cables are actually single mode types and they carry laser since we are going to higher and higher speed all the time  we tend to prefer single mode fibers these days of course  led has a very long life so this is one area in which led is definitely better whereas laser ? s lifetime seems to be short  although not very short if proper care is taken  they will certainly run for several years the temperature sensitivity for led is minor so for semiconductor laser it is substantial  so its life source has to be maintained at a particular temperature led naturally is low cost and laser is more expensive these are the pros and cons of the two sources  refer slide time  37  19 ? 39  06  let us took take a closer look at the kind of losses that we have in fiber remember  when we were discussing about electrical transmission through some copper medium ? we were talking about it in the last class ? there are several kinds of distortion to the signal first of all  the signal strength tends to weaken as we go over a longer and longer distance ; that is called attenuation the same thing happens in the case of fiber also  in the sense that as we go further and further the signal will get weakened you can look at this way that if the signal did not weaken  then we can look through a glass of any thickness that is not true ; the transparency of the glass  although it is very highly transparent  is not 100 %  that is why as it travels down the fiber its strength will become lower and not only that  it will also get its wave shape and also get somewhat distorted due to certain phenomena for example  there is this phenomena of rayleigh scattering ; that means due to slight changes in the refractive index of the glass some of the light will get scattered then there are other kinds of scattering called mie scattering due to the imperfection of the cylindrical structure these losses are non uniform for different wavelengths that is why on the other end your signal will arrive first of all weakened  and secondly in a slightly distorted fashion  refer slide time  39  06 ? 40  09  this figure  this famous figure  is the plot of the loss that will happen to a light signal at different wavelengths as you can see  this loss in the fiber  given in db per kilometer  is not uniform you can see that it is not uniform across all the wavelengths so there are some wavelengths  namely here  where the loss is very low then there are other wavelengths where the loss is quiet high what we do is that we try to find some kind of windows  where the loss would be low and we can go to high distance because  remember that if the loss is low  refer slide time  40  09 ? 41  17  we can go much longer without any amplification or repeated kind of action and that is good i mean that would make the thing cheaper and of course we would be able to carry data for longer distance these are the three useful windows so to say  one is the 850 nanometer window  the other is the 1300 nanometer window  and another is the 1550 nanometer window around these wavelengths  if we send our signal  it will go a long way so these are the three windows  which are used for data transmission because of the very high frequencies involved ? you can look at the frequencies from these wavelengths  you can calculate and you will see that the frequencies are very high ? it can potentially have a very huge bandwidth so the theoretical capacity of the fiber is very high ; it is limited by the optoelectronic devices and boxes at the two ends  refer slide time  41  17 ? 43  23  now let us see if we want to take the fiber optic signal to a long distance ; naturally  i mean whatever window you use after some distance depending on the kind of source you are using  the kind of frequency you are using  the quality of fiber you are using  it may be 5 kilometers or it may be 50 kilometers but when you are going thousands of kilometers  at some point of time the signal will become very weak so you need some kind of repeater function what is the repeater ? the incoming signal may amplify or make the shape all right ; so there are all kinds of repeaters repeaters are different gates ; there are some repeaters  which simply amplify the signal there are other repeaters  which can also make corrections to the shape of the incoming signal  etc you need this repeater function in order to go to a very large distance so we will just take a look at this interesting phenomenon  how do you repeat optical signals ? optical signals traveling for long distances through fiber need to be strengthened this may be done through olts ; now what is an olt ? that is optical line transmitter  which takes the signal to the electronic domain and  of course  you can use a fresh source over there to make a nice and strong wave form and push it for the next leg of its journey the important thing is that this may also be done in the optical domain and the advantage of doing it in the optical domain is that you are no longer restricted by the bandwidth limitations of electronics so you can really operate at very high speed always in the optical domain and one way to do that is with  refer slide time  43  24 ? 43  58  erbium doped fiber amplifiers so erbium has a large number of excited states and from some of the excited states it gives out 1550 nanometer light  exactly the wavelength used in the third window in the glass so a few meters of optical fiber are doped ; that means a small quantity of this erbium is introduced in that ; the glass is doped with the few parts per million of erbium and is pumped with 1480 or 980 nanometer laser  to give amplification so what would happen is  refer slide time  43  58 ? 44  39  you look at this suppose this is the ordinary fiber  which is carrying the signal and there is some portion of it which is doped with erbium and a pump laser of certain frequency is fed into this so what will happen is that the erbium atoms in this region will be in an excited state  so erbium will be in a excited state when a signal photon comes  this sort of induces the erbium to come down to the ground state  giving an amplified signal so this is a very simplified version of how erbium doped amplification is used  refer slide time  44  39 ? 44  57  there are other kinds of this ; depending on what kind of pump laser you are using  you may go to this kind of excited state or this kind of excited state from which you can go to excited state one and so on but anyway  the basic idea remains the same  refer slide time  44  57 ? 45  38  because of dispersion  that is chromatic dispersion and polarization  mode dispersion wave shaping is necessary after some distance there are other kinds of combination of wave forms known as solitons ; these are waves shaped specially to match the dispersion characteristics of fiber so that a soliton would not be distorted for a long distance distortion can also be counteracted by reverse fiber so all kinds of technology are there ; we do not have the time to go into the details of these  but this is a very up-coming and growing field  refer slide time  45  38 ? 46  25  once again  why do we like fiber ? ? because repeaters are needed only every 50 to 100 kilometers as opposed may be 2 to 5 kilometers for copper ; not affected by power surges  electromagnetic interference  power failures  corrosive chemicals  etc ; communication in a fiber is usually simplex that means there is the source on one end  receiver on the other end  so in one fiber the data is really going in one direction so for two-way communication  we require a pair of fibers  but these two fibers have more capacity than 1000 strands of twisted pair  and that is really really great  refer slide time  46  27 ? 47  05  we will have just one quick look at where fibers are going ? people are putting fiber at a feverish pitch now one is the ultra long hall ? ultra long hall means we have fiber for a distance of may be thousands of kilometers then in the long hall we have this wdm or sonet  sgas etc  which is put by the telecom company or other communications companies then we have the wdm  atm  sonet  ethernet  etc in the metro  that means  within the same city  and now finally fiber is finding its way in the access side ? that means to individual users also  refer slide time  47  05 ? 47  41  these are the different ways fibers can reach your home  which is the ultimate goal of networking either you can take individual fibers to homes or we can take them to a switch  which is placed in the neighborhood and from there individual fibers go to every home there is also a concept of passive optical networking in that instead of keeping a switch out in the open  you put a passive sort of splitter  which splits the signal into so many parts so pon  passive optical network  is another possibility  refer slide time  47  41 ? 48  22  let us come to the other most important physical medium  namely  wireless one disadvantage of each of the data transmission methods that we have seen so far is that they are all wired connections moving from a wired connection to a wireless connection results in the ability to connect a network without having a physical connection what is the great advantage of that ? the greatest advantage of course is mobility that means if you are connected in a wireless fashion  you can move around but still remain connected  refer slide time  48  22 ? 49  24  this entire electromagnetic spectrum is used for communication this just shows a picture of that on the low end we have the radio  followed by microwave  which is of a higher frequency  followed by infrared  which is of still higher frequency then we have the visible light ; of course we talked about the fiber optics and this part has not been used for communication as yet  may be in future these are the kind of frequencies we have so the frequency range is tremendous ? from 104 or may be 1014 or 1015 or so we have these twisted pairs in this region  coaxial cables  maritime signaling  am radio  fm radio  tv  terrestrial microwave  satellite  fiber optics by the way  radio  and sometimes tv also  terrestrial microwave  satellite are all used for computer communication also  refer slide time  49  24 ? 49  40  these are the different names for the different ranges  we have lf for low frequency  medium frequency  high frequency  very high frequency  ultra high frequency  super high frequency  extremely high frequency  and so on  refer slide time  49  40 ? 50  08  transmitting data  data is transmitted through a wave just as with coax ; that means the higher the frequency  the more the data that can be encoded and transmitted narrow band is often used as the number of watts/hertz is high  and there are different pros and cons at different frequency bands we will just look at some of them  refer slide time  50  08 ? 50  35  sometimes a wide band is used ; using a wide band allows the transmitter to jump from one frequency to another in order to avoid communication jams and to hide detection that is just one example and this is nowadays used in ieee 802.11  which is a wireless lan standard we will look at this later on bluetooth is another wireless lan standard  refer slide time  50  35 ? 51  20  to start at the low end of the spectrum  at the radio transmission  this is very easy to generate  travels long distances and it is omni directional ; that means you have an omni directional antenna and you send your signal over there so it will travel in all directions and it will reach everybody around in a certain area that will not happen if you are using a very high frequency like microwave ; so at low frequencies  waves go to walls and power falls off sharply with distance from the source at high frequencies waves will bounce off of obstacles  refer slide time  51  20 ? 51  34  so there is a limit to the distance that a radio wave can cover vlf  lf  and mf bands are limited by distance on the ground high-frequency and very high-frequency waves can be bounced off the ionosphere  sending it back to earth  which is a very important thing  refer slide time  51  35 ? 52  01  this is a picture of what might happen in short-wave range ? you know the short wave radio ? you can listen to the radio transmission from usa what is happening is that it is getting repeatedly reflected off the ionosphere and reaching the other end of the earth  refer slide time  52  01 ? 52  23  there are problems with this wireless communication ; we will not go into all the details first of all there will be selective kind of attenuation  then there is a very irritating thing called multipath fading so what happens is   refer slide time  52  23 ? 52  47  for example  something like this  your signal may reach directly or your signal may reach through a path after getting reflected somewhere and these two may be out of phase so when they are out of phase  they will sort of cancel each other and you will have a very bad signal these are the problems we encounter in mobile phones  etc so you have to do something about these  refer slide time  52  47 ? 53  21  for microwave transmission  the transmission can be very narrowly focused so data can be moved from one tower to another you may have seen those microwave towers ; so they are sort of in line of sight with each other alignment is important because this is a focused beam if it is not aligned  your receiver will miss the signal altogether beams do not pass through buildings well these are the disadvantages of microwave if the waves are delayed  they may arrive out of sync  which is known as multipath fading  refer slide time  53  21 ? 54  13  finally  we have infrared and millimeter waves at the very high end of these ; of course  we have talked about optical fiber they are mainly used for short-range communication and they are strictly directional as we are going more towards the light  it is becoming more and more directed  as light is very directed so they are directional  cheap  and easy to use but they don ? t pass through solid objects you can not use them for a mobile phone  let us say  but you can use them for controlling your tv or for short-range connection to your computer from some handheld device  etc so this can be an advantage or disadvantage ? one way of looking at it is that since it does not go through walls  whatever you do in one room is going to not affect whatever you are doing in the other room so that may be an advantage also we tried to cover all the different ranges that we use in communication ; we have the satellites also as i mentioned  you have this geostationary satellites  which are nothing but repeaters on the sky  refer slide time  54  36 ? 54  50  so we can sort of send the signal from earth to the satellite  where it will be amplified and sent it back to earth these satellites could be geostationary or the satellites could be sort of low  earth orbiting satellites so they are also used for communication over long distances  refer slide time  55  00 ? 55  10  note  the rest is part of lec 5 faculty name prof sujoy ghosh lecture no # 5 multiplexing  shareing a medium  today we will talk about multiplexing  refer slide  55  27 55  34  multiplexing is about sharing a medium that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  55  42 ? 59  54  another simplest condition a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garble but for multiple signals can share one medium the medium must somehow be divided giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember that a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this band width is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned so what we tried to do is that we tried to use this bandwidth some how to to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers so that is the idea of multiplexing  refer slide time  56  34 ? 56  43  these line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company and most data devices individually the require modest amount of data but when the when a number of users their requirement are aggregated together the sum total may be quite substantial band width  refer slide time  56  55 ? 57  10  the current technique accomplish this includes frequency division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing we will look at many of some of these at least  refer slide time  57  10 57  55  let us see so this is the scheme of multiplexing you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link and on the other side depending on in which fashion you have put them together they started separated in two different lines so these now these different lines in the right they can now go to different recipients so just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here so the so a number of sender receiver pair is utilizing the same physical link in  refer slide time  57  57 ? 58  12  now to for the types of multiplexer as i mentioned that we have fdm that is the frequency division multiplexing  tdm that is the time division multiplexing  stdm that is the statistical time division multiplexing so we will look at these  refer slide time  58  11 ? 58  36  just quickly before we go into get into the details of each of these time division multiplexing each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else so we will look at the details of this later  refer slide time  58  37 ?
