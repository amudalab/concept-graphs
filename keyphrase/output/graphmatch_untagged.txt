similarity ‚ Ä ô of two graphs a good deal of research has been devoted to the graph isomorphism problem and to its generalizations  edit distance and maximum  minimum  common sub  super  graph  see  e.g   1 ‚ Ä ì 5    additionally  the emergence of very large graphs like the world wide web has generated tremendous interest in aggregate statistical measures of graph structure  such as clustering  diameter  and degree distribution between these two ends of the spectrum  there exists a class of similarity methods in which an element  e.g  a node or edge  in graph g a and an element in graph g b are considered similar if their respective neighborhoods within g a and g b are similar this idea naturally leads to iterative methods for computing similarity scores for the elements of these graphs  in which scores for similarity between elements propagate along to neighboring elements at each time step here  we consider a graph g a  va  e a  to consist of a set of vertices or nodes va  and a set of edges e a ‚ ä Ü va √ ó va  which can be directed or undirected the aim of this work is to highlight graph similarity methods from different Ô ¨ Å elds that utilize this iterative framework  and present a simple application of one particular extension to the task of graph matching  one in Ô ¨ Ç uential iterative approach was the hits search algorithm introduced by kleinberg in  6   he suggested that useful web search results could be divided into two different categories  ‚ Ä ò hubs ‚ Ä ô  which point to many good sources of information on the query ; and ‚ Ä ò authorities ‚ Ä ô  which are pointed to by high-quality hubs kleinberg proposed an iterative algorithm for computing a hub and authority score for each node in the web graph gw ; the authority score of a node n at iteration k is simply the sum of the hub scores of the nodes that point to node n at iteration k ‚ à í 1  and the hub score of node n at iteration k is the sum of the authority scores of the nodes to which node n points the even and odd ‚ à ó corresponding author  e-mail address  lzager @ mit.edu  l.a zager   0893-9659/ $  see front matter c  cid  13  2007 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  doi

procedure will each converge  but possibly to different limits which may depend on the initial values chosen  several other application-oriented algorithms also utilize the idea of recursively computing node similarity scores based on the scores of neighboring nodes ; these are the similarity Ô ¨ Ç ooding algorithm proposed by melnik et al  7   the simrank algorithm proposed by jeh and widom  8   the scoring method for phylogenetic tree construction proposed by heymans and singh  9   and the vertex similarity method of leicht et al  10   in  11   blondel et al view kleinberg ‚ Ä ô s algorithm as a comparison between each node in the graph gw to the two nodes of a smaller ‚ Ä ò prototype ‚ Ä ô hub ‚ Ä ì authority graph g h a  depicted in fig 1 the hub and authority scores of each node in gw are seen as similarity measures between each node in gw  and the hub and authority nodes in g h a  respectively  in the light of this observation  blondel et al generalize kleinberg ‚ Ä ô s update equation to construct a similarity measure between any two nodes in any two graphs blondel et al denote the similarity of node i in g b and node j in g a at stage k by xi j  k  and de Ô ¨ Å ne it via the following iteration  xrs  k ‚ à í 1  + xrs  k ‚ à í 1   r   r,i  ‚ à à e b ,s   s  j  ‚ à à e a this update is followed by a normalization of all of the scores byp i j  which we will denote by xi j ‚ Ü ê À ú xi j  as with the hits algorithm  this procedure will  in general  converge to different even and odd limits which will depend upon the initial conditions blondel et al choose to initialize x0 to the all-ones vector  and choose their Ô ¨ Å nal score to be the limit of the even iterations  r   i,r  ‚ à à e b ,s   j,s  ‚ à à e a i  j À ú x 2 we next present a related similarity measure that uses a linear update to generate both node and edge similarity scores that do not depend on the initial values of the node scores  then explore the application of this measure to graph matching  2 coupled node ‚ Ä ì edge scoring using the iterative method framework  in which two graph elements are similar if their neighborhoods are similar  we can immediately suggest one simple way to construct an edge score  an edge in g b is like an edge in g a if their respective source and terminal nodes are similar this de Ô ¨ Å nition of edge similarity introduces a coupling between edge and node scores  let sa  i  denote the source node of edge i in graph g a  and let ta  i  denote the terminal node of edge i the node set cardinality | va | will be denoted by n a and its edge set cardinality | e a | by m a it will be most convenient to represent the adjacency structure g a by a pair of n a √ ó m a matrices  the source ‚ Ä ì edge matrix as and the terminus ‚ Ä ì edge matrix at  de Ô ¨ Å ned as follows  sa  j  = i 0 otherwise ta  j  = i 0 otherwise   as  i j =  cid  26  1  at  i j =  cid  26  1 this representation has some useful properties  ‚ Ä ¢ das ‚ â ° as a > ‚ Ä ¢ dat ‚

entry  t is diagonal with the in-degree of each node in the ith diagonal entry  edge p in g b and edge q in g a an update equation for edge and node scores takes the following form  xi j  k  ‚ Ü ê x

the ‚ Ü ê notation  using the construction of source ‚ Ä ì edge matrices as and terminus ‚ Ä ì edge matrices at of a graph g a  the update process represented in eqs  1  and  2  can be written

determining the score vector x to which this procedure converges is a matrix iteration problem concatenating these vectors yields a single matrix update equation  ‚ â ° msk ‚ à í 1   5   cid  21  sk ‚

2.1 with the initial condition x0 chosen arbitrarily and with y0 = Œ ± gx0  where Œ ± is any positive constant  the iteration of eq  5  will converge to a unique set x of nonnegative similarity scores between every pair of nodes in g a and g b and a corresponding unique set y of nonnegative similarity scores between every pair of edges  proof first  we note the following result  presented as theorem 2 in  11   if a is a symmetric  non-negative matrix with perron root œ Å  and b0 is a componentwise positive vector of appropriate dimension  de Ô ¨ Å ne  then  provided ‚ à í œ Å is not an eigenvalue of a  the sequence bk converges to Œ † b0/k Œ † b0k2  where Œ † is the orthogonal projector onto the invariant subspace associated with œ Å  to apply this theorem directly  we can expand

0.115 0.445 0.202 as discussed in section 2  higher scores denote greater similarity  observe that the matrices gg > and g > g  besides being symmetric and non-negative  are also positive semi-de Ô ¨ Å nite  and thus have only nonnegative eigenvalues therefore  the result presented in theorem 2 of  11  applies note that the factor of 1 Œ ± that appears in the odd iterates will be eliminated by the normalization embedded in each step in the limit as k ‚ Ü í ‚ à û  the even and odd expressions are equal for both x and y  cid  3  the matrix g as de Ô ¨ Å ned in eq  3  is the sum of two matrices  each of which has a single ‚ Ä ò 1 ‚ Ä ô entry in each row  thus  if x0 is chosen to be the all-ones vector  a reasonable choice if no a priori information about node similarity is known   then gx0 = 2y0  where y0 is also an all-ones vector  and the initial condition constraint is satis Ô ¨ Å ed an example of the application of this method to the pair of graphs in fig 2 is presented in table 1  rather than a simultaneous update of node and edge scores  consider a sequential update  which could be de Ô ¨ Å ned as follows  yk = gxk ‚ à í 1  xk = g > yk or as  xk = g > yk ‚ à í 1  yk = gxk   6  it is not dif Ô ¨ Å cult to show  by an analogous argument to the proof of theorem 2.1  that the simultaneous and sequential update procedures all yield the same set of similarity scores  since the even and odd limits of the iteration converge to the same scores  we can focus on the even iterations and expand the expression for the node similarity update  xk ‚ Ü ê  g > g  xk ‚ à í 2 =  a ‚ ä ó b

letters 21  2008  86 ‚ Ä ì 94 thus  the coupled node calculation differs from that in  11  by the inclusion of additional diagonal terms that serve to amplify the scores of nodes that are highly connected  3 application  graph matching one common task in graph theory applications is the identi Ô ¨ Å cation of some kind of optimal matching between the respective elements  i.e  nodes and edges  of two graphs graph matching has received an enormous amount of academic treatment  in the pattern matching and data mining communities in particular  and many computationally ef Ô ¨ Å cient methods exist for different classes of graphs what is often sought in these problems is an assignment matrix p ; if set b has m elements and set a has n ‚ â • m elements  then p will be an m √ ó n matrix of 0 ‚ Ä ô s and 1 ‚ Ä ô s  with a single 1 entry on each row  and no more than a single 1 entry in each column if pi j = 1  then element i of b is matched to element j of a  under most common optimality criteria  an optimal p can not be found in polynomial time several authors have obtained approximations to p by Ô ¨ Å nding a matrix À ú p which has certain structural properties and minimizes the following objective for some matrix norm u  ka ‚ à í À ú p > b À ú pku  in  12   umeyama solves this problem for À ú p orthogonal  and thus square  for u = 2 almohamad and duffuaa À ú p doubly stochastic and u = 1 in present a linear programming formulation in  13  that solves this problem for order to obtain a permutation matrix p from À ú p  both authors apply the hungarian algorithm to À ú p the hungarian algorithm  originally formulated by kuhn in 1955  computes a maximum weight matching between two sets  each with n elements  in o  n3  time  14   the node scoring method presented in the previous section yields a matrix of similarity scores between nodes taken pairwise from each graph  which naturally suggests matching the nodes of two graphs by computing a maximum weight matching on this matrix of scores  we shall consider the following illustrative problem  identify the location of a subgraph within a larger graph to explore this problem empirically  de Ô ¨ Å ne a graph g a by generating an n √ ó n node ‚ Ä ì node adjacency matrix a ; each entry in a is set to 1 with a speci Ô ¨ Å ed probability p this is the de Ô ¨ Å nition of an erd ¬ ® os ‚ Ä ì r ¬ ¥ enyi gn  p random graph  15   a set of m ‚ â § n vertices of g a is selected ; the subgraph induced by these m nodes is denoted g b g b may or may not be connected next  the node similarity matrix between g a and g b is computed  using the scoring method described in section 2 finally  the hungarian algorithm is applied to the node similarity matrix to obtain a matching between the nodes of the subgraph and a subset of the nodes of the original graph that maximizes the sum of matched scores  the results presented here were generated in matlab r  cid  13   and utilized borlin ‚ Ä ô s implementation of the hungarian algorithm  16   observe that  since m ‚ â § n  the application of the hungarian algorithm requires padding the matrix of node similarity scores with extra entries ; these Ô ¨ Å ctitious scores are set to a negative number a success is counted for every match between a subgraph node and its original identi Ô ¨ Å cation in the larger graph ; note that this kind of accounting yields a lower bound on the success of the matching  since better or equally good matches that do not correspond to the original identi Ô ¨ Å cation are marked as failures  as a Ô ¨ Å rst test of this concept  this procedure has been applied to 15-node graphs with variably sized subgraphs and variable edge probability  connectivity  parameter p for each value of p  500 subgraphs of the speci Ô ¨ Å ed sizes were generated and the average proportion of successful matches was recorded the results are given in fig 3  fig 3 also depicts the expected proportion of correct matches if the subgraph nodes were randomly assigned to nodes in the original graph the computation of this lower bound is similar in concept to the matching hats problem  in which n party guests leave their hats in a room ; after the party  the hats are randomly redistributed now  imagine that n ‚ à í m of the hats are stolen  leaving m remaining the hats are then distributed randomly to the guests  analogously  in the subgraph matching problem  subgraph nodes are matched to nodes in the larger graph   one can show that e  # of correct matches  = m n   7  thus  the expected proportion of correct matches for a subgraph of size m is 1/n  the constant function of subgraph size plotted in fig 3 the details of this computation can be found in  17   which also contains the performance l.a zager  g.c verghese / applied

hungarian method applied to the node scores obtained from eqs  1  and  2   and averaging over 500 trials  bounds for the matching scenarios described in the following two subsections it is encouraging that the similarity based matching performance is a substantial improvement over the expected performance of random matching  some interesting features of the data of fig 3 can be observed first  it appears that higher initial connectivities lead to poorer performance additionally  better performance is achieved with larger subgraphs finally  note that when the subgraph is the entire graph  the procedure performs the matching correctly in all of the trials  3.1 nodes with type labels often in graph matching applications  there exists side information about the attributes of nodes and edges for example  the proteins that constitute the nodes of a protein interaction network might be classi Ô ¨ Å ed by their type when attempting to align these networks across species  one might want to only match proteins that share the same type the node matching procedures that have been discussed in the preceding section have used only graph topology to identify similarities ; including node identity information to penalize or reward certain matches may improve performance  we augment our subgraph matching procedure by assigning each node in the graph g a one of s labels with equal probability a random subgraph g b is identi Ô ¨ Å ed  retaining the node labels from g a once the node similarity matrix between g a and g b has been computed  scores between nodes with different labels are assigned a negative weight ; the maximum weight matching is then computed  performance results for this approach are presented in fig 4 as histograms of the number of correct node matches out of 500 trials for subgraphs of different sizes the averages for each number of labels and each subgraph size are drawn as vertical lines the expected performance results under the related random matching scenario  as derived in  17   are represented by the dashed vertical lines clearly  increasing the number of labels improves performance  we might also ask what will happen if there are only two node labels  which are distributed with asymmetric probabilities fig 5 depicts histograms of subgraph matching performance for a graph with two node labels  l ‚ à à  0  1   which are distributed with the probabilities indicated as expected  the more evenly the two labels are distributed  the more node identity information is communicated by the label  3.2 nodes with unique labels often  nodes will have unique identi Ô ¨ Å ers ; for example  there may exist reference points that can be uniquely identi Ô ¨ Å ed in pattern recognition problems to model this scenario  a random graph g a with n nodes is generated  then s of its nodes are labeled with unique identi Ô ¨ Å ers the remaining n ‚ à í s are given the same label a random subgraph g b is removed  carrying the node labels along in general  the subgraph g b will contain fewer than s of the uniquely-labeled nodes the node similarity matrix between g a and g b is computed  then edited by setting the similarity scores between nodes with mismatched labels to a negative number the procedure continues as described in section 3  92 l.a zager  g.c verghese / applied mathematics letters 21  2008  86 ‚ Ä ì 94 fig 4 matching performance

vertical line  while the expected performance under the analogous random matching scenario is given by the solid vertical lines  in fig 6  each curve represents the performance for a particular value of s as it is varied from 0 to 14 on a 15 node graph the dashed horizontal lines represent the expected performance under the related random matching scenario as s is varied from 0 to 14 matching performance improves steadily as the number of unique labels is increased  4 conclusions exploring the information about the graphs g a and g b contained in the similarity matrices is an ongoing task  what kinds of structural features common to g a and g b can be inferred from patterns in the similarity scores ? the node matching procedure can be applied to pairs of isomorphic graphs to generate self-similarity matrices ; in exploratory tests  an isomorphic mapping was always among the maximum weight matches the self-similarity matrices of some graphs communicate very little or no interesting information ; for example  any pair of undirected bipartite graphs  including those that represent the point ‚ Ä ì line incidence graphs associated with projective planes  has a set of node scores that are the same for every node pair while projections onto the dominant eigenspace associated with the matrix m as de Ô ¨ Å ned in eq  5  do not reveal any interesting structural information  it is possible that the l.a zager  g.c verghese / applied mathematics letters 21  2008  86 ‚ Ä ì 94 93 fig 6 matching performance using varying numbers of unique labels the dashed lines represent the expected performance of a random matching scenario for s from 0 to 14  subspaces associated with the strictly smaller eigenvalues of m do encode such information for many kinds of graphs  the spectrum of the node ‚ Ä ì node adjacency matrix is well characterized ; using the machinery of spectral graph theory to explore the matrix m would be worthwhile  novel applications might arise from any natural phenomenon with a graph structure  recall that kleinberg ‚ Ä ô s motivation in  6  was an improved web search tool  while blondel et al  11  applied their method to automatic synonym extraction from a dictionary graph another intriguing application of graph similarity methods is the identi Ô ¨ Å cation of functionally similar subgraphs within maps of protein interactions compared across different species  we have explored the identi Ô ¨ Å cation of such subgraphs in  18   and holme and huss have used a vertex similarity scoring method to predict the function of proteins in s cerevisiae in  19   finding new applications for this kind of similarity scoring might inspire some interesting new heuristics  or an entirely new approach  acknowledgments this material is based upon
