let/VB/let me/PRP/me just/RB/just begin/VBP/begin by/IN/by /,/, so/RB/so therefore/RB/therefore /,/, the/DT/the first/JJ/first topic/JJ/topic i/NN/i am/NN/am going/VBG/going to/TO/to talk/VB/talk about/IN/about is/VBZ/is counting/VBG/counting and/CC/and i/PRP/i will/MD/will start/VB/start with/IN/with an/DT/an example/NNP/example. so/RB/so /,/, suppose/DT/suppose there/EX/there is/VBZ/is

/,/, let/VB/let us/PRP/us just/RB/just /,/, very/RB/very simple/JJ/simple way/NN/way of/IN/of counting/NNP/counting. so/RB/so /,/, what/WDT/what i/PRP/i am/VBP/am saying/VBG/saying here/RB/here

of/IN/of the/DT/the woman/NN/woman as/IN/as the/DT/the mother/NN/mother of/IN/of the/DT/the year/NNP/year. and/CC/and so/RB/so the/DT/the number/NN/number of/IN/of possible/JJ/possible

are/VBP/are 2/CD/2. so/RB/so /,/, then/RB/then we/PRP/we say/VBP/say /,/, that/IN/that the/DT/the total/JJ/total number/NN/number of/IN/of choices/NNS/choices is/VBZ/is 24/CD/24. so/RB/so /,/, i/PRP/i sort/VBP/sort of/IN/of broke/NN/broke up/IN/up this/DT/this event/NN/event /,/, though/IN/though i/PRP/i will/MD/will call/VB/call it/PRP/it event/NN/event of/IN/of choosing/NN/choosing the/DT/the

/,/, the/DT/the first/JJ/first child/NN/child is/VBZ/is boy/JJ/boy and/CC/and the/DT/the second/JJ/second is/VBZ/is girl/JJ/girl or/CC/or the/DT/the first/JJ/first child/NN/child is/VBZ/is a/DT/a

what/WP/what since/IN/since they/PRP/they had/VBD/had two/CD/two possible/JJ/possible cases/NNS/cases /,/, so/RB/so 2/CD/2 into/IN/into 1/CD/1 by/IN/by 4/CD/4 therefore/RB/therefore this/DT/this is/VBZ/is half/DT/half /,/, and/CC/and so/RB/so this/DT/this number/NN/number comes/VBZ/comes out/RP/out to/TO/to be/VB/be 1/CD/1 1/CD/1 /,/, this/DT/this is/VBZ/is 0.175/CD/0.175. now/RB/now /,/, for/IN/for 1/CD/1 2/CD/2 when/WRB/when you/PRP/you want/VBP/want 1/CD/1 boy/NN/boy and/CC/and 2/CD/2 girls/NNS/girls /,/, then/RB/then that/IN/that means/NNS/means the/DT/the 3/CD/3 children/NNS/children /,/, so/RB/so the/DT/the probability/NN/probability of/IN/of having/VBG/having 3/CD/3 children/NNS/children is/VBZ/is 0.3/CD/0.3 /,/, 30/CD/30 percent/NN/percent of/IN/of

/,/, so/RB/so these/DT/these three/CD/three possibilities/NNS/possibilities are/VBP/are for/IN/for there/EX/there /,/, therefore/RB/therefore it/PRP/it become/VBP/become 3/CD/3 by/IN/by 8/CD/8.

/,/, and/CC/and for/IN/for beta/NN/beta equal/JJ/equal to/TO/to 5/CD/5 for/IN/for example/NN/example /,/, it/PRP/it will/MD/will become/VB/become more/RBR/more steep/JJ/steep like/IN/like this/DT/this

/,/, i/PRP/i mean/VBP/mean yeah/JJ/yeah /,/, beta/NN/beta is/VBZ/is going/VBG/going to/TO/to infinity/NN/infinity then/RB/then this/DT/this will/MD/will simply/RB/simply just/RB/just spike/IN/spike
