introduction to operating
operating system operating
system operating system
primarily provides services
services for running
fact that user
provided with services
facilitate the provisioning
services the central
engine called cpu
cpu a system
system should make
user s application
unit a user
application when required
facility to communicate
game for instance
output usually provided
times the user
generate an output
printed document output
applications document design
document design accounting
design accounting e-mail
accounting e-mail image
e-mail image processing
image processing operating
games we notice
application requires resources
resources for processing
processing information storage
storage of information
mechanism to inputting
inputting information provision
provision for outputting
information these service
facilities are provided
nature of application
offers generic services
services to support
operations these operations
operations in turn
facilitate the applications
applications mentioned earlier
operation is application
neutral and service
service specific user
user and system
point of view
view the primary
application in launching
launching an application
clue which application
clues for launching
launching a browser
document preparation application
human computer interface
interface which helps
helps to identify
identify an application
hides a lot
lot of details
selecting the application
examine the programs
details of character
character reading program
program are hidden
write a program
program for instance
printf command helps
helps to generate
generate the desired
form of output
figure essentially depicts
depicts the basic
user stand point
users and applications
ensure that system
resources are utilized
efficiently for instance
server each user
memory the system
determine which programs
programs are active
await some form
form of input
input or output
temporarily from engaging
engaging the processor
processor this strategy
strategy alone enhances
enhances the processor
policy and algorithm
algorithm to allocate
allocate the system
resources the evolution
worthwhile to trace
trace some developments
form of computing
mainframe computer system
system the mainframe
air conditioned area

group the submitted
jobs as fortran
jobs that required
required considerable processing
jobs which required
required a short
short and limited
set of jobs
jobs was considered
batch of short
short fortran jobs
jobs the output
separated and turned
area this scenario
scenario clearly shows
program would engage
engage the processor
processor this meant
processor would wait
i is completed
completed this meant
meant that processor
processor would idling
speeds were orders
orders of magnitude
led to poor
processor the systems
systems that utilized
utilized the cpu
cpu and memory
multiple users connected
shown in table1.1
principle of stored
stored program operation
scheme of things
memory and executed
70s this basic
operation was altered
altered and system
system designers contemplated
program is awaiting
engage the cpu
storing multiple executables
multiprogramming with multiple
multiple excutables residing
policy to allocate
memory and processor
utilizing the processor
process is engaged
engaged in input
output the processor
output are higher
leads to higher
multiprogramming while multiprogramming
multiprogramming did lead
lead to enhanced
operated in batch
batch processing mode
80s the system
system designers offered
offered some interactivity
capability to access
give every user
user an illusion
resources were operating
executed to strengthen
strengthen this illusion
illusion a clever
user was allocated
allocated a slice
allocated time slice
slice a users
executed now imagine
precisely time sharing
sharing systems attempted
systems attempted giving
giving each user
user a small
small time slice
slice and returning
lack of continuity
continuity in fact
carries an impression
systems clearly require
require several design
considerations these include
programs may reside
allocated to process
process each program
protect a users
program and data
i and processing
processing bulk storage
storage on disks
disks clearly witnessed
witnessed a phenomenal
helped to implement
implement the concept
concept to offer
offer an illusion
illusion of extended
storage the concept
concept of virtual
vogue the virtual
storage essentially utilizes
utilizes these disks
disks to offer
offer enhanced addressable
enhanced addressable space
space the fact
memory also meant
meant that multi-programming
multi-programming could support
programs in fact
required active parts
out this means
number of users
users can access
access the system
satisfy the notion
notion that computing
facility be brought
user as opposed
facility is brought
sense in fact
reflects the notion
