computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh lecture # 2 network topology  refer slide time  00  53  good day in this lecture we will discuss the network topology what do you mean by a network topology ?  slide reference time  01  04  01  14   refer slide time  01  15  02  33  we can just have a quick recap of what we have learnt last time basically a computer network could be a number of nodes  which are connected by some communication links there is some kind of what we usually call a graph representing the network this graph has a certain structure we talk about the structure this structure has an implication about how will we communicate i said it is in general not feasible to have one-to-one communication between each pair of node that is not possible at all so  we need a structure formed by the nodes connected in some manner that is the subject matter of discussion today so a network may be represented as a graph nodes may represent computer or network devices like switches  routers  etc and the links represent communication links modes of communication may be broadcast or point to point  refer slide time  02  34  02  49  first let us talk about the lan topologies lan is the local area network and local area network topologies are  star  ring and bus we will just look at all of them  refer slide time  02  59  04  30  we first take up this bus topology as this is a very simple kind of network this is based on a shared broadcast link we want to have point-to-point communication there may be so many nodes a  b  c  d etc  which are connected to the network a wants to communicate to b ; a specifically wants to communicate to b so each pair of communicating nodes uses the link for the short time so a uses the link for the short time to send his message to b after that is over may be c might send something to d or something like that so other nodes ignore the communication since this is shared broadcast link  all the links are shared by all the nodes for the communication hence that is not private in that sense so all the nodes get that communication but they usually ignore this communication whereas b will copy this for its own purpose there has to be a distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link ; otherwise  communications will collide in that shared broadcast medium the communication of both the pairs of node will get garbled but we want a  b and c  d to get clear signal so there has to be some distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link  refer slide time  05  12  05  59  now let us see bus topology what do we require ? the simplest thing is a single cable a single cable connects all the computers it is as if the computers are hanging from the single cable each computer is connected to this shared cable so computers must synchronize and allow only one computer to transmit at a time as per a protocol but as such  the network is very simple network with a single copper cable  refer slide time  06  00  06  26  so this is the picture of a bus we have this shared cable and computers are somehow connected to this so a will communicate to b b will simply broadcast over this medium b will capture it c  d  e  etc will all ignore this  refer slide time  06  27  08  25  the network is maintained by the single cable cable segment must end with a terminator otherwise  what will happen is that when some node  let us say a sends a signal on the cable not only c  d  etc will get it but it will get reflected from that other end if it is not properly terminated so it becomes a kind of unwanted noise in the medium which we do not want so the coaxial cable is used there are two types of coaxial cables traditionally used one is a thin coaxial cable called thin lan and the thick coaxial cable called thick lan and extra stations can be added in a daisy chain manner this technology is sort of getting outdated at the moment you still have maybe some thin and thick lans here and there but mostly people are moving out of this and the main reason why the people are moving out of this is because this connection is likely to become loose and as soon as you have a loose connection you will have a problem in communication there are some other reasons also why this technology has become obsolete these days but still if you have shared medium  i mean the technology of using a single cable with a single broadcast medium and some machines are sharing so this something like a bus topology  refer slide time  08  26  10  23  the standard which is used on this bus topology is ieee 802.3 actually what we do is to eliminate that cable and replace with something else we will discuss that later thin ethernet is the name of the technology when we use thin coaxial cable ? we call it 10base2 in this 10 stands for that it has a 10 mbps speed whereas 2 stands for the maximum range of segment length of 200 meters the maximum number of connections is about 30 devices four repeaters may be used to a total cable length of 1000 meters if you want to have a very long cable  what will happen is that  as the signal travels down the line  the signal will get weak and as the signal gets weak you have to regenerate the signal and one way to regenerate the signal is to use a repeater over there the repeater will simply take the incoming weak signal  amplify it and send the stronger signal down the line the maximum number of nodes that you can handle here is about 150  refer slide time  10  24  11  03  thick ethernet  which is the other version where you use a thick coaxial cable called 10base5  also has the same speed of 10 megabits per second but length up to 500 meters so they were used for backbones that are limited to 500 meters with a maximum of 100 nodes per segment that is somewhat more than a thin net and a total of four repeaters of 2500 meters that is also somewhat more than thin net  refer slide time  11  05  12  42  now the bus topology has both advantages and disadvantages it is very inexpensive as you have a simple cable it is easy to add stations you can have another punch on this cable and add new station that means a new computer the amount of cable it uses is also much less and may be  it works well for very small networks it is of course no longer recommended which means you will not get these parts any longer it is getting out of fashion because it is unreliable this is much less reliable than the technology that we have today the other disadvantage is that the limited number of devices that can be attached it is difficult to isolate the problems if there is a problem  then the whole network is down sharing the same cable slows the response rates  refer slide time  12  43  13  30  now we come to direct point-to-point communication that means this is not shared so this is some kind of a dedicated point-to-point communication so computers are connected by communication channels that each connect exactly two computers they are dedicated for this pair so this forms either a mesh or a point-to-point communication  and thus a complete graph we will come to that later this is some point-to-point network that means there is a dedicated link between some pairs of nodes it allows flexibility in communication  hardware  and packet formats and also provides security and privacy because communication channels are not shared  refer slide time  13  52  14  25  with point-to-point network  the network will look somewhat like this we have these two nodes or three nodes may be connected like this if we have four nodes and we want to interconnect everybody then we require six such cables as the number of nodes goes to n the number of cables you require is going to be nc2 which is n  n ? 1  /2 which is approximately equal to n2 which means the number of cables and the total length of cables that is involved are really increasing but the kind of cable which is usually used is not as expensive as the previous thin lan or the thick lan at the same time the amount of cable that you require becomes very high hence this kind of structure is not really recommended for a local area network suppose you have  say  10 nodes in a network and you are connecting everything to everything that means every node to every other node and length of the cable for some reason  let us say  is not an issue but then each node will be connected to 9 other nodes this means that in this particular computer you will require 9 ports to which these cables will be connected but that is not so easy to provide and this is another reason why  in a local area network  this kind of mesh topology is not recommended we have an alternative for that  refer slide time  15  55  16  02  we are coming to that alternative another reason why you can not connect everybody to everybody else can be illustrated thus  suppose there are two different buildings now the length of the cable will really become enormous because if you have n cables on one side and m cables  n nodes on one side and m nodes on the other side  you have a total of m ? n number of cables which are running between two different buildings it is lot of cables really so if we want to reduce the number of communication channels we have to  refer slide time  16  34  17  18  basically give up the idea of communicating directly in a lan it means that necessarily we share the connections among many computers there are ways of doing this by multiplexing here the computer takes turns in a very orderly fashion that is called time division multiplexing and it also must include some technique for synchronizing the use that means whoever wants to use that shared channel has to wait for his turn  refer slide time  16  34-17.18  we now come to this other topology  which is very common these days it is star topology a star topology looks like this there is a central hub  the centre of the wheel is called a hub  and a number of nodes are connected to this hub i may at this stage mention that there is a physical topology and a logical topology this is a star topology because it looks like a star its physical topology is that it looks like a star sometimes the hub is made in such a way that still this is a shared medium what is the advantage of converting to what was previously a bus ? it has some practical utility in the sense that  although the length of the cable is more in this case  the cable is a different kind of cable the cable connections are much better they do not get disconnected very often furthermore when you bring all the connections together centrally  you can handle the connections at one central point whereas  if you have a long running cable  it will be difficult to locate loose connections we will have to find out failures by going around so that becomes a bit difficult so the physical star topology still maintains a logical bus topology  which is an important thing otherwise this hub or the central node may not be a shared medium at all this is often the case these days  refer slide time  19  49  20  49  of course the previous star diagram is idealized usually you will have something like this you have this hub somewhere and then you have these different computers connected and there is a number which is written over here  rj-45 connector which is the kind of connection which has become almost ubiquitous these cables are something like the kind of cables which connect your telephones they are called utp cables or unshielded twisted pair cables they are basically easier to handle and are also cheaper these connections go on to the rj-45 connectors on both sides they are much more reliable than the previous thin lan or thick lan but the physical diagram may look something like this  refer slide time  20  50  21  36  you can have an extended star topology  which means different stars may be there  which are connected in some manner that means the hubs in those stars are connected and those hubs may be shared but may not be shared medium at all they may be what are known as switches these switches are connected if you look at this diagram  you have these different switches and from each switch we have a star connection to the different computers and the switches are connected in some fashion you can call this also as a star this is called extended star topology  refer slide time  20  50-21  36  you may have a hybrid topology some part of the network may be on a shared medium some part  maybe  is not shared and even in some part  you could also have a coaxial cable running  leaving a thin lan or thick lan although that is becoming less common these days  refer slide time  22  04  23  03  now we come to another topology  which is also very important topology  called as ring topology in ring topology  computers are connected in a closed loop this has a lot of advantage the way it works is that the first node passes the data to the second node ; the second one passes the data to the third and so on the data will go on hopping around the ring and what will happen is that  as it reaches the destination  if it will go around in a loop  it will surely reach the destination at some point of time the destination will copy the same in practice there is a short connected cable from the computer to the ring ring connections may run past offices with connector cables to sockets in the offices  refer slide time  23  04  25  45  this is an example of a ring topology actually  there are two rings in a ring the data will always go in only one direction if your destination is on the wrong side then the data has to come over the whole loop and then reach the destination so there is one ring for that what is the other ring for ? we put two rings or sometimes may be even three or four  two is quite common   one important reason for putting two rings is that if there is a failure in the network there is a possibility of the communication still going on look at the picture b let us say one particular node has come down that means  there is some problem in this thing if these nodes can sense that this has really gone down  they will sort of wrap the ring around now physically this still looks like a broken ring but if you look at it as a single ring  this is still a ring going through the nodes these nodes can still communicate although there is a breakage over here either this node may break or this link may fail so many things may happen so this fault tolerance is one good reason for using rings especially in the wide area network  we have a lot of things for example  let us say  these telephone exchanges are connected in some fashion using fiber optics cable we will be talking about all those things later on but they usually put them on a ring because if the cable is cut at some place they can still communicate by using the trick that i have just shown  refer slide time  25  46  28  24  this is the summary of the characteristics of the ring topology there is no beginning or end it is actually a ring all devices have equal access to media one good thing about it is that all of them should get data at some particular point of time so they have equal access to this media in a single ring  data travels in one direction only a double ring allows fault tolerance each device has to wait its turn to transmit that means you can not start transmitting as soon as you want to transmit you have to take your turn ; and most common type is the token ring token ring has got its ieee standard number  ieee 802.5   in a token ring what happens is that the token contains the data it reaches the destination data is extracted  acknowledgement of receipt sent back to transmitting device  removed  empty token passed for another device to use that is one way a ring can be used for example  you make a data packet with this token as well as whatever you want to send to the final user so this whole packet will go over to the next node in the ring this way  it keeps hopping from one node to another till the destination when the destination gets this packet  it knows that the destination had this or some kind of identification which will be there somehow in this whole bunch of data the destination node will know that this is meant for it it will extract the data it may be put in an acknowledgement if you are using the protocol which uses acknowledgement and send it along the ring it will go around the ring and come back to the original sender and the sender will know that this data has been received that will remove this acknowledgement also and the empty token is passed and this token keeps on circulating in the ring whoever wants to transmit has to wait till it gets the token .as soon as it gets the empty token it will put in the data that it wants to send and send it along in the same way  refer slide time  28  25  30  07  ring topology has its advantages and disadvantages the advantages are that  data packets travel at great speed now one reason why data packets can travel at great speed is that this is a very synchronous operation if you remember that in a shared medium where the nodes are not synchronizing their actions  what might happen is that two different nodes may start transmitting at the same time and then their data will collide in the broadcast medium  hence killing both the communications here such a thing can not happen because it has all been synchronized with the help of the token there are others ways of synchronization we will come to all that later on data packets can travel at great speeds there are no collisions it is easier to find faults and rectify faults and terminators are not required as in an ordinary cable the disadvantages are  it requires more cable than a bus and a couple of breakdowns may bring the entire ring down smaller rings exist nowadays but anyway they are not very common this is not as common as the bus so far as the local area network is concerned in a wide area network a ring is very common as a matter of fact the ring is the most common topology that wide area network could use  refer slide time  30  08  31  00  many lan technologies that use ring topology use token passing for synchronized access to the ring the ring itself is treated as a single shared communication medium bits pass from transmitter past other computers  and are copied by destination hardware should be designed to pass token even if attached computer is out of commission this is a small technicality if the interface of the computer to the ring can function independently of the computer  that will be nice  because even if the computer is shut down  other people ? s communications are not affected  refer slide time  31  01  31  38  this is a picture of the token ring  in which the sender holding token transmits bits of frames computer not holding the token passes the bits as they go around  circulate at a very high speed the destination passes the bits but it makes a copy and the sender receives the bits of a frame and it goes out this is one way the network could work  refer slide time  31  39  31  53  when a computer wants to transmit  it waits for the token after transmission computer transmits token on the ring to the next computer ready to transmit it receives token and then transmits this token ring was originally part of a lan technology  refer slide time  31  54  34  22  but then it fell into disuse first of all the token ring devices were less common they were more costly hence the token ring as a dominant lan technology went out with time but one version of it called fddi lived on and that lived on due to the very specific advantage that the ring topology has which is fault tolerance this technology is called fddi in a fddi  the ring is made of fiber optic cables multi mode fibers or even single mode fibers can be used they use fiber optic cables in which we can send data at a fairly high speed but the speed available is not comparable to the level possible nowadays fddi technology is also not that new it is aging and that way its speed may sound less today but when it was proposed it was taken as a very high speed the basic reason why somebody still would like to use fddi is its inherent fault tolerance capability that is the technology  which is used in lan  and it is fault tolerant ring technology  which is fault tolerant  is extensively used some other technology is extensively used in wan but in the lan we have this fddi technology whose full form is fiber distributed data interconnect this is another about ring technology which uses fiber optic between stations  which transmits data at 100 mbps when we were talking about the thin lan and the thick lan we were talking about 10 mbps speed ? 100 mbps was an order of magnitude high when it was proposed it uses pairs of fibers to form two concentric rings in order to get the fault tolerance we require with two fibers or two rings  refer slide time  34  23  35  48  as soon as a fault occurs somewhere  the fddi will automatically switch off and communication will not get disturbed furthermore you can have hybrid topology in the sense that you can have a ring  which emanates from the various nodes of the rings stars will form ; they will be the different hubs of the different stars and these different hubs can be put in a ring as a matter of fact  this is the very common way how fddi is configured some fddi switches form a ring and from each of these fddi switches  we can start other kind of technologies like ethernet etc  which form a tree-like structure the other reason why you could have hybrid topology is that older networks are updated and replaced  leaving some older segments you have replaced one part of network ; you will get a hybrid kind of topology thus it combines two or different more different types of topologies the common one is star bus or star ring star ring uses an mau  multi-station access unit   which is basically a part of fddi  refer slide time  35  54  38  48  next we take up the study of mesh topology by a mesh or a full mesh  it is meant a complete graph as shown here as discussed earlier  a complete mesh would take a lot of cable but at the same time with complete mesh we have lot of alternative paths from any node to any other node the diagram shows eight nodes and each one of them is connected to every other node now between any two nodes  you will have direct path and indirect paths as well we have many paths for going from the same source to the same destination this means that when one of the links breaks  all of them can still communicate without any problem as this arrangement takes lot of cables  we do not use this what we use is a partial mesh in a partial mesh some of these links would be dropped  taking care that none of the nodes becomes disconnected but all the links of the mesh need not be there even in the partial mesh we can still have some form of redundancy and thus have some level of fault tolerance but it may be not as much as one available in a full mesh for such a partial mesh the network topology is not well specified and it is difficult to evolve a protocol like token passing protocol so here you have to have some other method of sensing the faults and correcting them that becomes more complicated but the partial mesh topology is used in many places  refer slide time  38  49  39  55  mesh topology of course is not common on lans these are most often used in wans to interconnect lans because wan links usually are costly the users of a wan link naturally expect a certain grade of service that is why the wan service providers usually keep alternative paths if one of the paths becomes unavailable due to some node failure or due to some link failure then it can still send the traffic across the wan through some alternative paths  refer slide time  39  56  40  35  so the pros and cons of mesh topology are like this the advantage is of course it improves fault tolerance and it can carry more data the disadvantages of course are increased cost installation  difficulty in management and troubleshooting  slide reference time  40  41  41  20  now we have seen that each of these topologies has advantages as well as disadvantages rings ease synchronization  but it may be disabled if a cable breaks star is easier to manage and more robust but it requires more cable bus requires fewer cables  may be disabled if cable breaks and is not so reliable bus would not have fault tolerance really so as far as the lan is concerned  people are gravitating towards star topology that means some nodes or some computers may be connected to a switch and then some other computers may be connected to some other switch and then these switches will get connected in some fashion extended star topology is the most common topology as this is emerging in local area networks in wide area networks we have both ring as well as mesh topologies  refer slide time  41  21-46  12  the physical and the logical topologies may be different something will look like a physical star but it may actually be a ring let us look at the following examples suppose you have this as the hub of the star and we have these three stations a  b  and c ; we have say cable ducts running over there like this  through which a number of cables are passing at the central hub you might connect two cables like this and then more pairs of cables in a similar manner because this is one central place you can do this what you essentially have is a ring what you essentially have is a ring similarly  you can have any other kind of topology suppose you have a number of cables coming in like this now if we have a connection like this and similarly in all other places  then you can actually have a mesh although all this is within one physical duct and another physical duct going to nodes a  b  c  and d  it looks very much like a physical star but the actual connection is something like a mesh just as i could make a star  i could make it a mesh also the media is the physical topology whereas the way in which data access the medium and transmits packets is the logical topology a lan at a network is not always revealing cables emerging from a hub do not make it necessarily a star topology it may actually be a bus or a ring in a star topology  there is some piece of network box  which is called a hub this hub actually replaces the single cable this is again a shared medium if they are connected like a star it has got the star connection people use hubs these days but they do not use the single cable like thin lan and thick lan though it looks like a star  depending upon what kind of box it is  it could be actually a bus similarly as i have shown you  it could be a ring also  refer slide time  46  14  47  27  now the choice of logical topology is going to affect the physical topology and of course the other way around the kind of physical topology you will have will also dictate the kind of logical topology that you can have the kind of logical topology you can have will depend on two things ? one the actual physical topology  the number of cables you have etc  another is the type of network boxes like switches  hubs or whatever you have as the nodes we have to design carefully because it may be difficult to change the part way through the installation when you think about designing a network  you have to put the physical topology min place to get the correct logical topology your choice will determine cable installation network  network connections and protocols and spots where you will drill holes in the building  refer slide time  47  33  50  48  the different factors which you take into account while deciding on a particular topology are  the first thing that comes is what kind of technology you are going to use ? there are different kinds of lan technologies ? for example  if you are using fddi  then you have to have a logical ring somewhere if you are using the ethernet  you may have an extended star topology the kind of technology you are using is a factor and of course this technology will have some cost benefit as a matter of fact  in a lan  you will find that apart from the network boxes  in greenfield kind of situation   the cost of the cable is also significant then there is a question of scalability often what people will do is that  they will work with one kind of network and then  very soon  the network will get choked or people will want more bandwidth or more users will join this keeps on happening a network is never a stable thing in any organization ; but whenever you are putting some kind of topology or some kind of technology you have to think that 3 years to 5 years down the line  you will have to scale the network up you may have to change the number of your network boxes ; some of the boxes for example in old technology you may have had a bus by putting in a hub it was a physical star  but it is a bus now you put a switch over there and make it a star topology kind of thing and then later on people want more bandwidth when more people want to join  you have to design your physical topology that way for scalability  the bandwidth capacity and the ease of installation because how you take the cables around and how you scale up down and how you can install it are always problems ease of finding fault is another important factor we will talk more about it in the next class it is good to have a central cabling plan where all cables are coming you can manage all your cables in one central place .there are standards like structured cabling which are used for easy fault finding and maintenance thank you ! preview of next lecture good day ! today we will be talking about multiplexing  refer slide time  51  15  51  18   refer slide time  51  25  51  32  multiplexing is about sharing a medium different users share the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  51  40  52  00  a medium can normally carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signals will get garbled .for multiple signals to share one medium  the medium must somehow be divided to give each signal a portion of total bandwidth a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource as far as communication is concerned we try to use this bandwidth somehow to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers.that is the idea of multiplexing there are various reasons why we want to use multiplexing and the chief one is that of transmission services which are  refer slide time  52  43  53  35  very expensive  in leased lines packet switched networks  for example  laying of line in itself fairly expensive and complex proposition and once you lay a line you really like to utilize it to the maximum the other thing is that  if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication multiplexing and compression techniques save a lot of money for the business when you can send a lot of data through the same line the data capacity of the line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company .most data devices individually require modest amount of data but with a number of users their aggregated requirements may occupy quite a substantial bandwidth  refer slide time  53  52  54  03  the current technique to accomplish this include frequency division multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing  refer slide time  54  04  54  49  in the scheme of multiplexing  you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side .so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link .on the other side  depending on how you have put them together  they are separated into different lines these different lines can now go to different recipients on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here a number of sender receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in between  refer slide time  54  50  55  32  the alternative to multiplexing should be direct point to point connection this has number of problems .first problem is that you need those lines that we need for each device you thus need a large amount of wiring if they are on different floors  you need large number of io ports on the computer side  which really is not feasible you may have a few io ports  but you can not have hundreds of io ports it is really difficult to have hundreds of io ports .that is also another bottleneck   refer slide time  55  33  55  54  in a somewhat older approach  multi drop line   the host polls machine to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines total communications load is not greater than the rate of line  refer slide time  55  55  56  15  using a multiplexer approach all the device data ? s are multiplexed on one side  sent through one a line out link carries multiple channels of information  refer slide time  56  16  56  20  the signal will be restored depending on the quantum of noise present .if the noise is high then we will lose some information there will be some distortion and some loss of information would be there in case of digital signals it is more fault tolerant and more resilient compared to analog signals  refer slide time  57  01  57  17  we can correct errors in transmission using digital signals we add few bytes of error checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected i will give you a simple example  suppose we are sending groups of eight bits called byte now what can we do is that associated with each byte we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make the number of ones in whole nine bits to be odd  this is an example of odd parity now if at the receiver end we find that the number of ones have become even we know that  some bits must have flipped that means some bits must instead of zero have got a one and instead of one we got a zero it must have happened otherwise because the number of bits are supposed to be odd and of course by adding one bit we can always dictate that the number of bits in the original that means the sending station was odd .in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit the whole bunch once again hopefully there will not be error next time this is of course a very primitive kind of error checking there are more sophisticated error checking methods employed in networks and communications  refer slide time  58  40  58  48  computer networks prof .sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology i.i.t kharagpur lecture no # 3 physical medium  i good day in this third lecture we will be looking at physical medium in the last lecture we have seen two protocol stacks  we have seen osi protocol stack in detail and we had a look at its cpi pre reference stack but whatever be the model  at the bottom-most layer you have the physical medium because  after all  if two computers have to communicate  there has to be some physical medium between them so we will just look at some general characteristics of physical medium and how data can travel along them  today in the next lecture we are going to look at some specific media which are used in networks  refer slide time  01  36  2  26  as we talk about the physical medium  we have to talk about two different modes of communication  so to say one is analog and the other is digital  so you have before you that top one is the analog signal ; you can see that it can take any shape  and the digital signal is some kind of signal  which represents a series of ones and zeros ? stream of bits  but analog signals of course can take any value in them  refer slide time  2  27  3  20  and one important consideration for any medium is its bandwidth bandwidth is the capacity of a media to carry information now  the total capacity may be divided into channels ? i mean there is one total capacity you can sort of divide it into channels ? and give different channels to different users ; specific portion of the channel may not be used for direct communication but for control purpose and other specific purpose but whatever it is  any particular medium and technology will have a certain capacity and this is really important because  after all  your speed of communication will depend on the capacity of the medium  refer slide time  3  21  5  19  this inherent capacity of the medium is of course intermittently linked with the kind of signal one particular channel can carry for example  on the left-hand side  you see some digital signal and just on its right you have something that looks like a bargraph ? actually this is a representation of the same signal in a different way  what this right-hand side says is basically if you have a series of a sin x + b sin 2x + c sin 3x + d sin 4x and so on where a  b  c  d represent the values shown by the graph on the right-hand side  if you sum all that sin values up  you will get the signal on the left-hand side so the channel  if it has to carry the digital signal  has to be able to carry all these harmonics ? harmonics means the sin x constant  sin 2x constant  sin 3 etc so all these harmonics it should be able to carry ; whereas if you look at the second figure b  it is a pure sin wave so this just has one harmonic  a sin x or something like that this third figure has two harmonics  say a sin x + b sin 2 x ; so depending on the complexity of the wave form that you want to carry  you want more and more bandwidth for the channel  refer slide time  5  20  6  24  now for this we make a comparison of analog verses digital signals digital signals have some basic advantages the most basic advantages is that it is that less error prone that means if there is some kind of distortion in the signal between the source and destination that can be rectified very easily and to limited extent errors can be corrected whereas if you are talking about analog signal there is little control over signal distortion of course this also old technology and this has got some limitations in technology in the sense that how many people can use  etc there are some limitations over here so digital signals are of course in general preferred  although analog signal still rules in some niche areas  refer slide time  6  25  07  30  so let us see what we mean by the statement that digital signals are less error-prone in this figure we see in the left-hand side have some analog signal and then some noise has come ; that means  some distortion has come and the signal looks like the one below when noise affects an analog signal  it is hard to deduce the original signal from this whereas the same kind of noise or a similar kind of noise if it is gets superimposed on the digital signal as we see on the right  the signal gets distorted  but since we know that the original signal was sort of square shaped  we can deduce the original signal from the distorted signal so  despite the noise  noise can be eliminated easily in digital communication that is the greatest advantage of the digital communication  refer slide time  07  31 -8  51  and so far as the bandwidth of a channel is concerned  suppose we know the bandwidth  h  of the channel and the number of signal levels  v  being used  what is the maximum number of bits that we could transmit ? suppose we are trying to transmit bits in terms of digital signal ; so there is a nyquist limit it says that maximum bits per second = 2 * h * log2 v for example if the bandwidth is 3100 hz and we are using 16 level modulation then the maximum number of bits per second is log2  16  is four so 4 ? 2 ? 3100  that is 24800 bps 24.8 kbps so this is the maximum number of bits that we can send through the channel of this particular bandwidth so the higher the bandwidth of the channel  the higher the number of bits that we can send through it  but depending on the bandwidth  there is always a hard limit on how fast we can communicate  refer slide time  8  52-10  42  let us look at this regeneration of the digital signals once more we say that it is reliable because it can regenerate slightly damaged signals since there are only two states  for example  this is the original signal  which is a square  and it is grossly distorted as it is received this becomes weaker in strength and the shape has also been deformed but we can regenerate it since we know that the original shape of the signal must have been a square one so we regenerate it as a square one if there are two states of a voltage  let us say  + 10 volts ? 10 volts and the signal is + 8 volts  let us say  then it is quite possible that this that this + 8 volts is a result of noise  which is superimposed on + 10 volts rather than a result of noise superimposed on ? 10 volts so whenever you get + 8 volts  simply make it 10 volts with some electronics and the original signal will be restored of course i mean if the noise is very high  there is a limit to how much you can restore if the noise is very high then it will not be possible then we will know because ? 10 volts also becomes 8 volts in the case of a spike  and then whatever restoration we do will be a wrong one so we lose some information ; there will be some distortion and some loss of information will be there so there is always a limit but in the case of digital signals it is more fault-tolerant or resistant to noise  more resilient compared to analog signals  refer slide time  10  42  12  34  so we can correct errors in transmission ? that is another advantage of digital signals so what we do is that we add a few bytes of error-checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected i will give you a simple example  suppose we are sending groups of 8 bits called bytes ; now what we can do is that associated with each byte  we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make let us say the number of 1s in the whole 9 bits to be odd  this is an example of an odd parity now  if at the receiver ? s end  we find that the number of 1s have become even  we know that some bit must have flipped that means  some bit must have flipped ; instead of a 0  we got 1 and instead of a 1  we got a 0 it must have happened otherwise  because the number of bits was supposed to be odd ? and of course by adding 1  we can always dictate the number of bits in the original that the sending station was odd ? in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit that whole bunch once again ; hopefully there will not be an error next time this is of course a very primitive kind of error-checking ; there are more sophisticated error-checking methods employed in networks and communication so this error-checking and correction of error at the receiver ? s end is possible if you have adopted a very sophisticated coding technique so that is possible in case of digital transmission ; this is not possible in analog transmission  refer slide time  12  36-14  04  another advantage is that a digital signal can be encrypted  which makes it possible to carry sensitive information on the network for example  e-banking is coming in vogue ? that means  somebody does a bank transaction on the network similarly e-commerce ? that means you want to buy something online and then pay through your credit card  etc online now how does the transaction take place ? the point is that you are sending some information  may be your credit card number  may be some password  etc somebody can snoop on you in-between  so they will know your secrets and use the same set of numbers to may be buy something else  and the money will go from your bank account ; that is obviously not acceptable in this case when we send it down the network  we encrypt it in a way that even if somebody snoops and finds out the stream of bits that is going  he will not be able to make out the original numbers from this current stream so this is encryption and this is a very important application these days  refer slide time  14  05  15  54  so encryption is another advantage of digital transmission compression is another ; that means  we can compress a message before transmission and decompress it at the other end so the overall load on the circuit and the network is lighter ; since the load is lighter it is less expensive sometimes when you compress information there may be some loss of information ; there are lossy compression techniques and they are non-lossy compression techniques lossy compression technique is where you may lose some information  but it may not matter for example  let us say you want to send a digital photograph a digital photograph may have a very high resolution ; if you compress it and decompress on the other end  you may lose a few bits but the image that you get on the other end would still look almost as good as the original one of course  trained persons can look at it and find out there is something missing but it will almost serve the purpose sometimes loss compression is acceptable and of course there is loss-less compression also when you compress it and send it  it is a less expensive way of sending i mean you are sending the same information but only your are taking less amount of space ; of course you have to do the compression and decompression at the two ends  so that is some kind of overhead on the two sides  refer slide time  15  55  17  07  suppose we have some data ; how do we encode this digitally ? well  the simplest way  of course  is by the presence or absence of a signal let us say a positive voltage might represent a binary zero or a binary one or vice versa maybe if you have high voltage  you say that is i will interpret that is as one being sent and if i have a low voltage i interpret this as a zero being sent of course  when i am saying voltage  i am assuming that we are having some kind of electrical signal traveling ; that is not always the case for example  if you are using light for communication the presence of light may indicate one and the absence of light may indicate zero so whatever we code it  whatever be the medium  this is the simplest wave to encode data into a digital form the current state indicates the value of the data  refer slide time  17  08  18  31  if your signal is digital  sometimes you are forced to send some digital signal by analog transmission  but this is usually not preferred analog signal will transmit whatever signal comes regardless of whether it represents digital or analog data so it uses amplifiers other than the kind of regeneration that is possible in digital voice  the trouble with amplifiers is that it also boosts noise  whereas in the digital case we could take out the noise and regenerate the original shape of the signal here we can amplify it  so that if a signal becomes weak we can make it stronger ; but whatever noise is coming with the signal that also gets amplified this is okay for voice  but for digital data using analog transmission usually is not done because we have so little control over the correctness of whatever we are sending  refer slide time  18  32-19  58  digital transmission is concerned with the content of the signal ; it uses repeaters which recover the pattern of zeros and ones and then retransmits this can be used with analog signal if it carries digital data you know sometimes analog signal carries digital data ; it recovers the digital data from the analog signal  generates new clean analog signal this is becoming more standard ; for example  when you are connecting to the network  to the internet  from your home computer you may have use the modem and the telephone connection now what is happening over here is that the telephone line is essentially an analog medium ; so an analog signal will go over there on that  but whatever is coming out of your computer is digital so what you do is that you make this digital data ride on some analog signals to this modem pairs so that it reaches the telephone exchange at the telephone exchange it is converted back to digital data and the backbone and the core of the telephony system is purely digital  refer slide time  19  59  22  26  so there are various ways in which you can encode digital information in the analog domain one is the amplitude shift keying  which means the two binary numbers 0 and 1 are represented by two different amplitudes of carrier waves this is not very efficient ; uses up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines ; and is used to transmit digital data over optical fiber in the amplitude shift keying  although the signal is analog we know that there are only two levels  which this signal is supposed to take  i.e  two amplitudes  low amplitude and high amplitude it may be 0 and some amplitude if a 1 is to be transmitted may be we give this high amplitude and if a 0 is to be transmitted  we may use a low amplitude analog signal you may say this is the kind of thing which is done in the optical domain ; but in the electrical domain this is not very efficient more common is the so-called frequency shift keying in frequency shift keying  we use the two binaries ; that means we use two different frequencies for the two binary digits  0 and 1 so this is less susceptible to error than amplitude shift keying  and again  it sends up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines and is commonly used for high-frequency radio another way of encoding is the so-called phase shift keying two binary numbers may be represented by phase shift of carrier wave ; so this is more efficient and noise resistant than fsk ; this is psk it can be raised up to 9.6 kbps  kilo bits per second  on a voice grade line this is for a simple phase shift keying ; of course  we use more complex phase shift keying with other techniques in order to achieve even higher data rates nowadays  refer slide time  22  27  24  01  these techniques can be combined so it is common to combine phase shift and amplitude shift keying so we can get about 56 kbps on a voice grade line the modems that we buy usually are all 56 kbps  connected with some technique called multilevel signaling each signal represents more then one bit so this is also possible one is the signal  which indicates the level of the voltage or whatever it is  the phase or frequency  the level of the signal ; the other is the bit or bits that it may represent so  for example  if you have a simple technique  it will represent a 0 or a 1 by the current level of the signal  which is the simplest kind of technique  these two are the same one is the bit rate  that is  the number of bits of information that you are sending ; the other is the baud rate  that is  the number of times the signal will change per second ? the maximum number of times the signal will change per second so in the simplest case  baud rate and bit rate may be the same but that is not always the case  refer slide time  24  02  29  29  so we look at the other side of the coin  which is the digital encoding of analog information and a very common case is the telephones for example  as i just now told you  the heart of the telephone exchanges and the telephone switches and the trunk exchanges and the core network of the telephone system are nowadays entirely digital whereas our voice  of course  is analog by the way  the real world  in which we move around  is mostly analog now this digital is something that we adopt in-between in order to get these advantages of robustness  resiliency  error correction  etc our voice is analog  but the core telephone system is digital so at some point  our voice  an analog signal  has to be converted into a digital signal of course  our handsets also are mostly analog so they are going to be carried may be in this analog fashion right up to the nearest exchange ; but there  there will be a set of codecs  coders and decoders  which will convert this analog voice signal to a digital signal now  what kind of digital signal will a voice give ? the calculation is something like this  the voice data in a telephone system is limited to a maximum of 4 khz this telephone is a very good quality  the first so-called gold quality but this is not high fidelity kind of sound it is less than high fidelity  but very very clear  for all practical purposes for the telephone at least if i limit the bandwidth to 4 khz  we get some distortion  but nothing very noticeable so voice is still very clear we have to send this 4 khz of analog signal  whatever information is there  within 4 khz bandwidth we have to send this analog signal to the other side in a digital form ; that is  we have to digitize it there is a nyquist rate  which is like the nyquist limit that we have seen some time back nyquist rate  which says that if we sample any analog signal at double the maximum frequency that the particular analog signal has  then essentially we will have all the information that is needed to fully reconstruct the original analog signal from this sample so if you have 4 khz of signal  4 khz of bandwidth  we require 8000 samples per second let us say you have this analog voice ; so per second we will take 8000 samples  sample values at different points so  of course  at some points my voice may be low so i may have a small amplitude ; at some point my voice may be very high so i can have a large amplitude now that we break up each of these into a code of 8 bits  the point is that with the 8 bits  you can really distinguish between 256 levels and our assumption is that from the 0 level to the highest level that is admissible  we take it ; whatever it is  if you break it up in to 256 parts  that is good enough for capturing how high or low the volume is so a level of 256 is really quite a lot we require 8 bits for each of the sample and we require 8000 samples that makes it 8 ? 8  that is  64 kilo bits per second  64 kbps please remember this rate ? 64 kilo bits per second ? it is the fundamental unit on which a whole lot of all other technology  etc has been built and basically  it has come especially from telephony  because the telephone people had the first network and 64 kbps happened to be the rate which was set for a voice so naturally  of course  if you want to carry 1 voice channel  we will have a 64 kbps if you want to carry 1000 voice channels  you will require 64 kbps ? 1000  that is  64 mbps capacity so they planned their network depending on how many voice channels they want to carry where ; but 64 kbps is the basic unit in most places in telecommunications  refer slide time  29  31  32  53  now let us take a quick look at how data is encoded the simplest one is of course using the level of the voltage ; for example  over here this is the non return to zero level  the so-called nrz encoding it uses two different voltage levels to represent 0s and 1s ; typically negative voltage equals 1 and positive voltage equals 0 and the signal never returns to 0 voltage so it flip flops between a negative voltage and a positive voltage the value during bit time is a level voltage ; that means  during the duration of a bit 0 or 1 the voltage really remains the same so there is a transition at the boundaries of bit and of course  if there are two 1s then there will be no transition as we can see ; if there are two 0s consecutively  then there will be no transition so the number of transition is much less and it is a very simple kind of scheme this has some problem we will come to that later on ; but let us look at another variant of this non return to zero  which is nrzi that means non return to zero and invert on 1s that means once again we keep constant voltage during bit time ? no transition represents 0 and transition from low to high or from high to low is a 1 so the same bit pattern  0 0 1 1 0 1 is represented by a different voltage pattern over here there is no transition 0 0 and then there is a 1  so there is a transition ; there is another 1  there is a transition ; 0 no transition ; then again the 1  then another transition so this is another way of encoding now the trouble with these encodings is that suppose you have a large number of 0s  a large train of 0s  there is no transition really by the way  there is one point ? the reason they use the positive voltage and negative voltage rather than a positive voltage and zero voltage or zero voltage and negative voltage is that you want to distinguish between a 0 being sent and no signal being sent so that is one point and the other point is that as i was saying if there is a constant train of 0s in the original data then we will have a constant level signal in the system now if that be so  the synchronization of the clocks between the sender and the receiver tends to drift off and then the receiver  i mean in the worst case  the signal may go one off or it may interpret the signal in a very wrong fashion so this is the problem of this nrz and nrzi  which is taken care of  refer slide time  32  54  33  46  by some other kind of encoding ; we will come to that later on so this is a just a quick look at the disadvantages of nrz code ? hard to tell where one bit ends or starts ; with long string of 0s or 1s  any drift between timing of transmitter and receiver results in errors so there is a bit phase encoding  which uses the least transition per bit time so if you use at least one transition per bit time  what would happen is that the sender and the receiver clocks can remain in very close synchronization with each other ? that is a nice property ? and there is predictable bit transition during each bit time so an absence of a transition indicates an error so two examples are manchester and differential manchesters  refer slide time  33  47-34  29  so this is manchester encoding you see that at the middle of each bit 0 or 1  there is a transition now  low to high transition means 1 and high to low transition means 0 so the same pattern ? 0 0 1 1 0 1 ? is there for each bit ; you will see there is a transition in-between  and low to high transition is 1 and high to low transition is a 0 so this is the encoding  which is used in ethernets and many lans  refer slide time  30 35  42  there is another variant of this called differential manchester ; in this  the midbit transmission is really for clock synchronization purposes they do not represent either 0 or 1 so what it does is that transition at the beginning of a bit period is equal to 0 and the absence of a transition is bit period 1 so 0 0 ? when this 0 starts  there is a transition transition at the beginning of the bit period is a 0 ; but when the 1 starts  there is no transition there is a transition in the middle anyway ; that is for clocking purpose then at the next level  once again if there is no transition if there is a second one coming  there is no transition and so on this was used in token ring networks ; of course token ring networks are becoming less popular these days but anyway  this is another one there are other kinds of encoding techniques  but these are the common ones so you see that there are different ways of encoding the digital data into these different signal levels  refer slide time  35  43  38  29  signal levels and bit rates are different the rate at which the signals change is the baud rate  and the rate at which bits are sent is the bit rate the other thing we can consider is the analog encoding of analog information of course  this does not come too much in computer networks  but this is an important area in communications in general so of course  if you have an analog signal  it can directly be sent sometimes it is sent in the raw form ; sometimes that is not very practical  so we have to convert this to an analog signal maybe at higher frequency  and the most common example of this is the radio for example  a radio is carrying voice or may be some sound  etc the voice  as you know  is only 4 khz  but if you take a 4 khz signal and try to send it over the atmosphere  it will not reach any where  excepting in its close vicinity so  in order to reach out to all these different locations  you have to send your radio signal at a very high frequency ; but the information that is it carrying is still at that 4 khz bandwidth so this 4 khz bandwidth is sort of translated ; so there is a very high-frequency so-called carrier wave  which is carrying this 4 khz of signal if it is only voice of course if it is music  etc  you may like to have a somewhat higher bandwidth also ; but anyway  that is also analog signal and this is also analog signal so one analog signal is carrying the other analog signal and there are various ways of doing this so-called modulation the three most common ones are amplitude modulation  frequency modulation  and phase modulation so we will not talk much about this because in amplitude modulation as you can understand  the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal ; similarly  in frequency modulation the frequency of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal ; and then in pm the phase is changed according to the signal  refer slide time  38  30 -39  58  so this is another picture of digital signaling so called current state ; that means zero represents the low voltage one is represented by the high voltage and digital signaling and state transition ; so if there is no transition that is zero if there is a transition that is the one so these are all different examples of encoding  refer slide time  38  59  39  35  as i was telling  the bit rate and the baud rate are different the maximum number of times a signal can change in a second is called the baud rate and the number of bits  1s and 0s transmitted in a second is called the bit rate in the examples we have seen so far  the bit rate and baud rate are the same ; this is not always the case the bit rate can be higher than the baud rate if we use more then two signal levels ; and the other one is also possible  the bit rate may be lower than the baud rate  refer slide time  39  36  41  15  now let us look at some of the inherent trouble with all these physical media that means  when we are throwing some signal  when we are trying to send some signal down some transmission medium ? it may be a piece of wire it may be this whole atmosphere or it may be a fiber optic cable ? there will be some kind of distortion  some kind of change in the original signal  that will inevitably come into play so we will look at some of these ; we have to really take care of all these these signals and these kinds of effects can not be eliminated i mean the world is not perfect and they are basic properties of the medium so we will have to design our systems in such a way that in spite of all these efforts the whole communication will still go on very correctly as a signal propagates  the signal changes as it travels ; so the receiver may not be able to recognize it as such for example  this shows an example of an original signal and the final signal this kind of change and distortion etc may be attributed to the following effects   refer slide time  41  16  42  51  the first one  the very first one  is attenuation a signal get weaker as it propagates ; attenuation becomes greater with distance naturally  and of course  finally  the signal will become too weak to recognize so the original signal strength is something but as the distance grows signals become weaker and weaker for example  let us say this kind of weakening is dependent on the property of the medium ; it also depends on the kind of frequency you are using for sending for example  let us say an am signal will not be received at a very large distance  whereas a short wave signal may travel some other way and come over here similarly  if you take a local area network or a cable  then if you make the cable very long ? there are other technical problems for making cable very long ? but even from the signal propagation point of view  the signal will get weaker and weaker because there will be leakage currents in the cable  current will leak out  etc finally  the signal that we will get will be very weak so this is a very fundamental property of any medium similarly  if you take an optical medium and if you send a light pulse through it  as it travels  the light pulse will get weaker ? that is one of the effects there are other effects  but this is one of the major effects  refer slide time  42  51  44  27  apart from attenuation  there is distortion that means  the signal changes shapes as it propagates now if it changes shapes in this way  the adjacent bits may overlap  may make recognition impossible for the receiver  so what might happen if the signal changes shape ? why does it change the shape ? if you remember in the very beginning i had shown you one slide of a square wave kind and we talked about some harmonics so the square wave may be looked upon as a sum of all these harmonics  a sum of all these sign waves now all the harmonics or sign waves are of different frequencies ? we had talked about the sin x sin 2 x and sin 3 x and so on ? so they are of different frequencies now signals of different frequencies change or get affected by the medium differently so a signal of a particular frequency may be attenuated less ; the signal at a much higher frequency may be attenuated much more or vice versa the point is that signals at different frequencies will get affected by the medium in different ways so finally  the relative strengths of the different frequencies will be different when you go to the far end ; that means  when you go to the receiving end  when you add that all up  you will get a different shape you will not get the old square shape or whatever shape you have sent ; you will not get that back so this is called distortion  refer slide time  44  27  45  31  then  of course  it is going to pick up noise there is thermal energy in wire  which is everywhere so this energy is some kind of inherent noise that will always come ; then there will be random signals so spikes may sometimes occur ; say  some car is starting somewhere so there will be some static discharge ; the lightning strikes somewhere  there is somebody running a motor  somebody is running a washing machine  all these things add to the general noise in our atmosphere and this medium  which is carrying a signal  will also catch some of this noise sometimes of course  the noise is so sharp that it may change the transmission in such a manner that you will not get the original signal back so sometimes such a thing may happen  refer slide time  45  31  46  47  what we want is a high signal-to-noise ratio in order to distinguish between the signal and the noise if the noise is very low and the signal is high  we can still distinguish at the receiving end between what is a signal and what is a noise and take the signal out  take out the noise but for this we want a high signal-to-noise ratio signal strength divided by the average noise strength is the snr and as snr falls  error will increase so in this figure  you can see that as the signal becomes weaker and weaker and touches the noise floor may be goes below it when it goes below it  the noise becomes more than the signal ; then no meaningful communication can be carried out so in general  we want a strong signal-to-noise ratio so one thing we might do quite often is that suppose we do have to send a signal to a very long distance  the signal will naturally get weak so in-between  we will put some amplifiers or repeaters or regenerators  which will take the signal  try to filter out the noises as much as possible  then amplify the signal and make it stronger  and then push it for the next span so after some distance  again another repeater will take it up and regenerate the signals we have to go on doing that so that i maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio even at the receiving end  refer slide time  47  26  47  38  then of course  as i said that  there is interference that means energy from outside the wire adds to signal  like noise  which is often intermittent  and is very hard to control or diagnose  refer slide time  47  38  48  49  one important point is that a very strong interference can occur at cable termination so there are two things  first of all  if two cables are running in parallel  what might happen is the signal in one may affect the signal in the other so there is some kind of linkage between the two the so-called cross talk ? that is one thing this is more pronounced at the termination end ; at the termination end  if you do not terminate the thing properly  if you just leave it like this  the kind of distortion and the kind of noise that will be introduced will be much more so whenever we are putting some wired kind of network infrastructure  we have to be very careful about the termination  because that is where a lot of noise can come in so often there will be multiple wires in a bundle ; each radiates some of its signal  causes interference in nearby wires and this is especially bad at terminations where wires are unwound and are parallel  refer slide time  48  49  49  36  finally i just mentioned this  that when carrying digital data over analog lines  we require modems modem stands for modulation and demodulation this is used to connect a digital computer to an analog phone system usually  but modems can also be used elsewhere it can be installed internally or a card inserted into the motherboard or can be connected to the serial port  etc so now we understand why modems are required because essentially  digital data will have to be carried on the analog system the field of communication  as you know  is a very interesting field and we could not go too much into the details of communications but we have just talked about the very basics of communications used in computer networks  because remember computer network or some computers or some network nodes are connected via some communication lines so communication is absolutely important ; it is all-important in this ; so we have talked about this.in the next lecture  we will look at some of the medium that is actually used or deployed in common networks thank you preview of next lecture lecture no # 4 physical medium  ii today we will  have the second lecture on the physical media in the last lecture we have seen the different ways the digital signals and analog signals  etc how they can be used for communication how digital data or analog data can be encoded and some of the general impairments of physical medium in this lecture we are going to look at specific media which are used in networking  refer slide time  51  18  51  20   refer slide time  51  21 ? 52  30  so there are basically two types of mediawhich are used for communication one is cable i mean they are two different classes are together so one is a cable now this cable could be some copper cable they could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair so the twisted pair i mean we sometimes there actually unshielded twisted pair or utp sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common there are shielded twisted pairs also and then of course the one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic these are the different types of cables that we use in networks similarly we can also communicate without the use of any cables by simple electromagnetic radiation and these radiation could be in different ranges of the frequencies like they could be infrared or microwave or radio or satellite etc so we will look at all these one by one  refer slide time  52  31  55  25  first let us look at the kind of media that we use in a lan lan as you remember is a local area network and a local area network could vary from let us say one meter to one kilometer so its is local strictly by some means of size in some way so one meter means two computer connected siding on the same table connected side by side it could be all the computer in one building and all the computers in several buildings and so on so that is the kind of range that we have for lan  and the medium that we use for lan they could be coaxial cables  utp  fibers  wireless so you would note that basically most of the types of cables that we talk about find their way in some ways or other in local area networks and of course utp or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories so that cat is for categories so we could have cat3 cable cat 5cable  cat 5e cable  cat 6 cable  cat 7 cable and so on .you must have seen cat 3 cable if you looked all your telephones that is the landline phones they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of categories three for computer networking i mean cat three cables could also be used for lan although we usually prefer cat five onwards the kind of things that are on the network that could be pbx  pbx is your local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports etc ethernet is one technology which is used in lan atm is also used  fddi is sometimes used fddi if you remember is fiber distributed that is the fddi ring kind of structure so there are some networks even smaller than lan they have called personal area networks some networks so i may have be varying three or four computers and they or connected in a network on my body o we will come to pan later on but going on the other side of the spectrum that means from lan to a bigger network this is man that is a metropolitan area network typically one campus or one city may be several small towns which are closed together they would come under the preview of the man  so man by ballpark figure man would be extent of about ten kilometers  so it could be 5 kilometers or it could be twenty kilometers so something in that range  refer slide time  55  26 ? 57  48  and the kind of medium that we use for a metropolitan area networks coaxial cables both base band and broadband  we will come to this what they are sometime utp are used but that is not very preferred way of connecting although utp are used one way utp is definitely used are when you try to network to telephone lines that is i mean telephone linesi told you they use utp it could be a hybrid kind of system  some part of it could be coaxial some part of it could be utp and some part of it could be fiber fiber means  fiber optic cables and kind of things of course that kind of technology that goes into a man would be pbx different kinds of modems for example if you are using a broad band coaxial cable you might use something what is known as a cable modem  then you have this long ethernet that means on the ethernet on the over may be some lines cable tv dsl digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless one issue which is important in man is the issue of access alright that means how do you reach to each individual users.i mean think of a town or a city so you really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost ok  if it is a small building like in a lan you can take very good say utp cable to his room  now there are problems of taking utp cable to each individual house i mean there could be i mean electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost ok if you are trying to build so much copper into that is quite costly so how to access to users who are distributed over somewhat wide area in the sense of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks  refer slide time  57  49  58  41  finally at the extreme of the spectrum we have wan that is wide area network so they may stretch from ten kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers  so 10000 kilometers almost to the other side of the globe so they can involve very very long distance  medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology that is used in wan are sonet or sdh that the almost similar technology atm ip that is the internet protocol  dwdm dense wavelength division multiplexing  geo and leo geo stands for geostationary satellite is a short form of geostationary satellite and leo is low art orbiting satellite computer networks prof .sujoy ghosh dept of computer science & engineering i.i.t  kharagpur lecture no # 4 physical medium  ii  refer start time  0  45  good day today we will have the second lecture on the physical medium ; in the last lecture we have seen the different ways these digital signals and analog signals  etc can be used for communication  and how digital data or analog data can be encoded well  we are mostly interested in the digital form of data  how they can be encoded etc  and some of the general impairments of physical medium in this lecture we are going to look at specific media  which are used in networking  refer slide time  01  33 ? 01  34  refer slide time  01  34 ? 02  43  there are basically two types of media  which are used for communication  one is cable they are actually two classes of cable now this cable could be copper cable or could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair the twisted pairs are actually unshielded twisted pairs or utp sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common ; there are shielded twisted pairs also then  one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic these are the different types of cables that we use in networks similarly  we can also communicate without the use of any cable  by simple electromagnetic radiation and this radiation could be in different ranges of frequencies  like infrared or microwave or radio or satellite  etc we will look at all these one by one  refer slide time  02  44 ? 05  09  first let us look at the kind of media that we use in a lan lan  as you remember  is a local area network that could vary from  let us say  1 m to 1 km so it is local strictly by its size ; 1 m means two computers connected on the same table or connected side by side ; it could be all the computers in one building and all the computers in several buildings ; and so on that is the kind of range that we have for lan the medium that we use for lan could be coaxial cables  utp  fibers  and wireless most of the types of cables that we talked about find their way in some niche or other in local area networks and  of course  utp or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories we could have cat 3 cable  cat 5 cable  cat 5e cable  cat 6 cable  cat 7 cable and so on.you must have seen cat 3 cable ? if you have looked in your telephones that is the landline phones  they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of category 3 for computer networking  cat 3 cables could also be used for lan  although we usually prefer cat 5 onwards the kind of things that are on the network could be pbx ; pbx is local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports  etc ethernet is one technology  which is used in lan ; atm is also used ; fddi is sometimes used fddi if you remember is fiber distributed  that is  the fddi ring kind of structure we have network boxes like hubs  switches  routers  etc so these are the terms you would come across of course we would talk about some of these in more detail later on  but these are some of the technologies that come into lan or local area networks  refer slide time  05  09 ? 07  22  then we come to slightly bigger networks  called man or metropolitan area networks there are some networks which are even smaller than a lan ; they are called personal area networks i may be wearing three or four computers and they are connected in network on my body so we will come to pan later on going on the other side of the spectrum  that means  from lan to bigger network  which is man  a metropolitan area network  typically one campus or one city may be several small towns  which are close together they would come under the purview of a man man is a ballpark figure ; it would extend may be about 10 kilometers ? so it could be 5 kilometers  or it could be 20 kilometers or something in that range the kind of medium that we use for metropolitan area networks is coaxial cables  both base band and broadband ; we will come to what they are sometimes utp are used but that is not a very preferred way of connecting one way where utp is definitely used is when you try to network through telephone lines utp could be a hybrid kind of system wherein some part of it could be coaxial and some part of it could be utp and some part of it could be fiber fiber means fiber optic cables the kind of technology that goes into a man would be pbx  different kinds of modems  for example if you are using a broadband coaxial cable you might use something that is known as a cable modem then you have this long-reach ethernet that means ethernet over may be some lines  cable tv dsl digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless one issue which is important in man is the issue of access that means how do you reach to each individual user ? think of it as a town or a city ; you really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost if it is a small building like in a lan you can take utp cable to his room there are problems of taking utp cables to each individual house ; there could be electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost so if you are trying to build so much copper into it that is quite costly so to access users who are distributed over a somewhat wide area of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks  refer slide time  08  32 ? 10  08  finally  at the extreme of the spectrum  we have wan  wide area network so they may stretch from 10 kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers or almost to the other side of the globe they involve very very long distances the medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology used in wan is sonet or sdh it ? s almost similar technology atm  ip ? that is the internet protocol ? dwdm  dense wavelength division multiplexing  geo and leo geo stands for geostationary satellite and leo is low art orbiting satellite so these are the kind of technologies that go into wan one issue in man is of course always cost and bandwidth  wan bandwidth because as you can imagine that when you have to take some message across hundreds of thousands of kilometers away there is a lot of cost involved in it so wan bandwidth is usually costly and we try to make the maximum use of this bandwidth of course in recent times lot of fiber has been laid internationally so the bandwidth problem is becoming less and less  but even then wan bandwidth remains costly  refer slide time  10  08 ? 12  43  now let us see some of the cable specifications that we use  first we take up this utp cable of category 5 so cat 5 utp cables specification says about 100 mhz and these can stretch up to 100 meters these are the figures which are normal  you can stretch things little bit this way or that way at times depending on your operating circumstances  etc but this is normally the figure ; so you can have some kind of idea from these the cat 5 cable looks like your standard telephone cable ; the only thing is that they are made to a slightly better specification the connector at the end of a cat 5 cable has got a specific scientific number ; this is called rj 45 so we use rj 45 connectors for connecting cat 5 cables there is a standard ansi or tia or eia standard for how cat 5 cable is to be used what are the standard ways and how they are twisted  etc there are a number of wires inside the twisted pair of cables ; so which wire stands for what  etc i simply refer to the name of the standard here  which is eia 568 a and then a cable has to be tested according to some standards ; tsb 6795 is the standard for testing cables cat 5 cable is usually under these circumstances 100 mhz to say 100 meters if you are within the 100 meters  if you have done everything properly it is expected that it can work up to 100 mbps the point is that if the distance is much less than that then naturally the same cable can work at a much higher speed so inside the same room the cat 5 cable may be used for 1000 mbps connection between computers or network nodes  refer slide time  12  43 ? 13  26  there is some enhanced version of cat 5 cable ; i will not go into the details of this  which are given over here the specifications are almost the same ; only thing is that this is slightly better in some way and it can work for 1000 base tx for small distance i said within a room if you are using cat 5 e cable instead of simple cat 5  you may be able to operate at 1000 mbps without much of a difficulty  refer slide time  13  27 ? 15  24  then we have the cat 6 cables  which is again slightly higher than cat 5 cables here  the specification is 250 mhz this specification is much higher ; so naturally cat 6 cable would be somewhat costlier than cat 5 or cat 5 e cables the same kind of connector is actually the recommended cable for operating at 1000 mbps so here is a point when networking started  people thought that 10 mbps is a fairly high speed and soon people were using networks a lot and 10 mbps was not enough  so people went to 100 mbps now people are saying that 100 mbps is slow ; so we want to go to 1000 mbps you see that in a comparatively short period of time  may be 15 ? 20 years  our demand for bandwidth has grown a thousand-fold when you are planning for an infrastructure  say copper infrastructure  in any organization or somewhere  then you should keep this in mind that whatever specification people are giving you today  after some time people may want to upgrade what i mean to say is that if you put in cat 6 kind of cables and use it for only 800 mbps today  then 1 or 2 years later you can use the same cable for 1000 mbps saving a lot of cost at that time ; but of course  that would mean a higher upfront cost today so that is always there  refer slide time  15  25 -16  44  so for testing these kind of cables there are all kinds of testing parameters i will not go to the details of these at all this is a rather technical part return loss is a measure of the reflected energy caused by impedance mismatch in the cabling system when you put a cabling system you can test it and one of the things you might test for is return loss and another thing you might test is a cross talk as reflected from the other end elfext is defined as the measure of signal coupling from a transmitter at the near end into a neighboring pair measured at the far end  relative to the received signal level on the same pair these kinds of testing parameters are there for testing copper cables similarly if we have put fiber optic cable somewhere  then fiber optic cables would have some other testing parameters it ? s a good idea to test the passive networking infrastructure  meaning all these cables and connections etc  and how they perform  refer slide time  16  45 ? 18  23  now from unshielded twisted pair cables  we go to the base band coaxial cables we have already mentioned about the base band coaxial cables these are the cables we were talking about when we talked about the bus topology if you remember ; so it is basically a shielded cable there is a copper cord surrounded by an insulating material  which is surrounded by braided outer conductor  which is surrounded again by a protective outer covering so this is considerably thicker than a utp and then in the coaxial cables also there are two varieties  the so-called thick coaxial cable and thin coaxial cable this technology is becoming obsolete now  but just for our knowledge  a thick coaxial cable is also presented as 10base5 this 10 represents that it works at 10 mbps and 5 represents that it can go up to 500 hundred meters the thin coaxial cable is 10base2  so it works at 10 mbps and goes up to 200 meters as i told you  nowadays almost everybody wants a 100 mbps to their desktop  in which case this thick and thin coaxial cables  that is the base band coaxial cables  are no longer of much use today  refer slide time  18  23 ? 20  57  but another type of coaxial cable  which is very much in vogue and which is used even today  is the kind of cable that your cable operator puts many of you have seen that cable operator puts some kind of coaxial cable into your room  which goes into your tv now it is possible to use the same infrastructure for computer communications also  i.e  computer networking also remember  i told you while discussing man that one of the most important issues in metropolitan area network is the issue of access ; that is  how do you reach each individual subscriber at his or her home ? this cable operator has reached lot of homes anyway so naturally  people started thinking whether we can use these cables from the cable operators for network communication  and special kinds of modems were designed for that called cable modem so we have a broadband cable infrastructure rather than the base band that we were talking about this is quite often used and now they are being deployed in many cities for computer communication this is  as i said  analog signal carrying tv signals and has been used for carrying data traffic older cables carry up to 450 mhz and the newer cables that have been put can go to higher frequencies  that means  higher bandwidth  and these cables use amplifiers at regular intervals now these amplifiers in the old days were only one-way amplifiers because the way the cable operators wanted it is that they are broadcasting their signal from some central location and it just has to reach people ? s tv but when you want to use this for computer communication the communication has to be two-way so the amplifier also has to be a two-way amplifier so such small technicalities are there ; it requires an amplifier at regular intervals and is a shared medium usually this medium is shared  that means  you and your neighbors ? all your data is in the same medium  refer slide time  20  57 ? 22  27  as i said  for carrying data  two-way amplification is necessary dual cable systems are like two trees  both rooted at the head-end ; the head-end is where all the service providers ? equipments etc are placed so there are all kinds of split systems  they use 5 to 30 mhz for inbound traffic and the rest for outbound traffic ; mid-split system and there are all kinds of systems for using this for data communication by the way  there is also some asymmetry that people have found in the network traffic for an average user in a city one of the most popular uses of computer network nowadays is just going onto the internet  may be surfing it  may be getting some information  etc but the amount of traffic in terms of query etc  which flows from the user to the computer  wherever it may be  is relatively small whereas you may be downloading large files  images  may be even songs  movies etc your bandwidth requirement ? the upstream bandwidth requirement and the downstream bandwidth requirement are usually not the same ; there is an asymmetry  refer slide time  22  27 ? 24  03  now we come to another very important kind of cable  having looked at copper cable  namely  optical fibers optical fiber basically is made of glass  very pure and very transparent silica glass is used  which is very very transparent in the sense that it can go up to tens of kilometers without too much of attenuation on the way so think of a glass slab  which is several kilometers thick and you can see through it quiet easily  so that kind of transparency is required so  naturally  there have to be some very strict standards for making this glass but after all  it is simply a glass  which is drawn into fiber for giving us this optical fiber at moderate dimensions  light is restricted to the fiber because of total internal reflection for ordinary light ; this is called a multimode fiber at still smaller dimensions  say something like 8 to 10 nanometers  the fiber acts like a wave guide for lasers this is known as a single-mode fiber multimode fibers are used for local area networks whereas in all wide area networks and even in local area networks these days single-mode fibres are more preferred for carrying signals  refer slide time  24  03 ? 26  55  finally what is optical networking ? one thing is  naturally  optical transmission by the way  optical transmission could be fibers or free space free space means suppose you direct a laser from the source to the destination on the free space  light will travel straight or it is expected at least to travel straight and then reach the receiver so you do not need any fiber or anything at all but there is a problem the first obvious problem is that the sender and the receiver have to be on the same line of sight without any hindrance in-between  that is one point and then there are other complications  which might come ; in the sense that the intervening air may get hot and its refractive index may change so the light may actually bend  like they do in a mirage in a desert that kind of things may happen  so it might miss the receiver altogether so free space optic communication is not very much preferred people prefer to put fiber optic cables wherever they can these cables or free space we are talking about is for fiber optic transmission then there is the question of optical switching ; can we provide the network level functionalities in the optical domain itself ? this is a topic of research these days as this is quite promising so maybe we will just look at this later on finally  why optics ? the point is that optical fiber capacity is huge  very huge ? you see 50 terabits per second is mentioned over here the point is that this has got an absolutely fantastic bandwidth  so if you can put a fiber optic connection between two endpoints your present as well as foreseable future requirements will surely be met so that is one good thing about optics the other very good thing about optics is that it is immune to electromagnetic interference  if there is a lightning strike nearby  then it is not going to affect this very thin strand of glass that we have put  which is very good because if the same thing happened to a copper cable  there would be a surge and it could maybe burn some of your equipment so this is another reason people favor fiber optics a lot  refer slide time  26  55 ? 29  27  now the point is that this 50 terabits per second bandwidth that we were talking about is only theoretical actually sometimes  i have been asked what the bandwidth of this fiber optic cable is ? this really does not make much sense because the bandwidth of any fiber optic cable you would find would ultimately be dictated by the kind of boxes that you connect to it the limitations would be there ; the limitation is not inherent in the fiber fiber can take up a huge bandwidth as i just mentioned  but at the two ends you will have some optics and then you will have some electronics now electronics can not work at that kind of speed a single piece of electronics suddenly can not work at that kind of speed ; so the overall speed at the bandwidth that you can get out of this fiber would depend on the kind of electronics that you put at the two ends that is why there is a lot of interest these days in whether some of these electronics can be replaced by optics so that we can get much higher bandwidth now not content with just sending data through only one wavelength through this fiber  we have what is known as wavelength division multiplexing that means different wavelengths of light carry different signals through the same fiber optic channel ; that is called multiplexing we will come to wdm later on with this wdm  you can get higher kind of bandwidth lucent  for example  demonstrated 64 lambda ; that means  64 different wavelengths into 40 gbps that is each of them operating at 40 gigabits per second over a distance of 4000 kilometers  so i think that is really great there are two kinds of wavelength division multiplexing  namely  coarse wavelength division multiplexing  which is somewhat cheaper  and dense wavelength division multiplexing  which is used in wan but is much more costly sothe number of wavelengths that we can use today varies from may be 8 or 12 to may be 64 or so people are working on this ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing  which can carry us to may be 100 wavelengths in the same fiber  refer slide time  29  27 ? 31  02  for a quick history  in 1958 laser was discovered then in the mid-60s guided wave optics was demonstrated  in 1970  we saw the production of low loss fibers because we want this low loss  we will be talking about this loss presently after sometime so this made long-distance optical transmission possible there was the invention of semi conductor laser diode  which was important then in 70s to 80s we used fiber in telephony in the form of sonet or sdh do not bother about what they are right now ; we will be talking about them later on in mid-80s  lans and man were sort of being put in place and in late 80s  we had a breakthrough in optically amplifying optical signals so there is edfa and rbm  dot fiber amplifier ? we will be talking about that too in this lecture itself ; and then in mid to late 90s  this dense wavelength division multiplexing system started being put and in late 90s and in 21st century optical switching systems  different components of optical switching systems are been developed all the time the point is that fiber optics has such a tremendous potential that there was a lot of interest in this and there is a lot of work going on in this area at the moment  refer slide time  31  02 ? 32  17  so here is some kind of a picture of a cross-section of a fiber optic cable as you can see  when you see a fiber optic cable  you will see this fad jacket  which is just a productive jacket made of plastic  rubber ; then inside it  there will be glass fiber but what you see is actually not the fiber ; that is also actually a cladding but that is made of glass inside this cladding there is this very fine core  which actually carries the signal in one fiber optic cable like this  you will have several such individual fibers so these are all individual fibers what has been shown over here are the individual fibers and each of them will carry one ; i have shown only 3 over here but it is typical to have something like 4 cores  8 cores  24 cores  120 cores in one cable  refer slide time  32  17 ? 34  02  let us look at this diagram of how it is so if you take a cross section  there is cladding on two sides and core in-between if you sort of cut it side ways  this is the kind of picture you get and what happens is that once the light comes into the core it sort of refracts like this and it impinges on this wall at a very wide angle of incidence there is a difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding that is always maintained so the point is that the core is at the higher refractive index and the cladding at lower refractive index there is total internal reflection over here  so even if the fiber bends a little bit ? although light usually would travel straight but through this total internal reflection it would follow this fiber ? it can take small bends and come out of the other side of the fiber but of course there are limitations to how much you can bend first of all  if you bend this core too sharply  this core will get damaged so there are limitations on what is your bending radius  radius of curvature  etc but in general to this total internal reflection the light will follow this core so this is another picture ? light is input from one end so this sort of follows the fiber and gets out of the other end  refer slide time  34  02 ? 35  02  well the light gets out  but how do you get it into something ? that means  how do you connect these fiber cables  which are actually glass fibers  how do you connect them to other things ? there are two ways of termination ; we can terminate a fiber by plugging it into a fiber socket and then sort of clamping them together we can splice them mechanically by putting the two cut ends into a sleeve and clamping them or we can fuse them to form a solid  which is a better method of connecting fibers even when you fuse them what will happen is there will be some kind of disturbance ? that glass material will not be totally homogenous at the junction so there will still be some loss but this loss is quite low if you are very careful in this splicing  referred slide time  35  02 ? 35  27  and what about light sources ? we have two different light sources ; they are called semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes naturally  the first one gives out lasers whereas the other one  the simple leds  give non-coherent lights so they are simple leds both have their advantages and disadvantages  refer slide time  35  27 ? 37  19  when you are using the semi-conductor laser ? laser as you know is coherent light and simple led gives you non-coherent light ? so the data rate for lasers can be much higher with lasers and this is low fiber type you can use multimode fibers over here and you can use single mode fibers we prefer single mode fibres for lasers the distance that an led can cover is short whereas the distance that single mode fibers  that means lasers  can travel through a single mode fiber is really long so all our long-distance cables are actually single mode types and they carry laser since we are going to higher and higher speed all the time  we tend to prefer single mode fibers these days of course  led has a very long life so this is one area in which led is definitely better whereas laser ? s lifetime seems to be short  although not very short if proper care is taken  they will certainly run for several years the temperature sensitivity for led is minor so for semiconductor laser it is substantial  so its life source has to be maintained at a particular temperature led naturally is low cost and laser is more expensive these are the pros and cons of the two sources  refer slide time  37  19 ? 39  06  let us took take a closer look at the kind of losses that we have in fiber remember  when we were discussing about electrical transmission through some copper medium ? we were talking about it in the last class ? there are several kinds of distortion to the signal first of all  the signal strength tends to weaken as we go over a longer and longer distance ; that is called attenuation the same thing happens in the case of fiber also  in the sense that as we go further and further the signal will get weakened you can look at this way that if the signal did not weaken  then we can look through a glass of any thickness that is not true ; the transparency of the glass  although it is very highly transparent  is not 100 %  that is why as it travels down the fiber its strength will become lower and not only that  it will also get its wave shape and also get somewhat distorted due to certain phenomena for example  there is this phenomena of rayleigh scattering ; that means due to slight changes in the refractive index of the glass some of the light will get scattered then there are other kinds of scattering called mie scattering due to the imperfection of the cylindrical structure these losses are non uniform for different wavelengths that is why on the other end your signal will arrive first of all weakened  and secondly in a slightly distorted fashion  refer slide time  39  06 ? 40  09  this figure  this famous figure  is the plot of the loss that will happen to a light signal at different wavelengths as you can see  this loss in the fiber  given in db per kilometer  is not uniform you can see that it is not uniform across all the wavelengths so there are some wavelengths  namely here  where the loss is very low then there are other wavelengths where the loss is quiet high what we do is that we try to find some kind of windows  where the loss would be low and we can go to high distance because  remember that if the loss is low  refer slide time  40  09 ? 41  17  we can go much longer without any amplification or repeated kind of action and that is good i mean that would make the thing cheaper and of course we would be able to carry data for longer distance these are the three useful windows so to say  one is the 850 nanometer window  the other is the 1300 nanometer window  and another is the 1550 nanometer window around these wavelengths  if we send our signal  it will go a long way so these are the three windows  which are used for data transmission because of the very high frequencies involved ? you can look at the frequencies from these wavelengths  you can calculate and you will see that the frequencies are very high ? it can potentially have a very huge bandwidth so the theoretical capacity of the fiber is very high ; it is limited by the optoelectronic devices and boxes at the two ends  refer slide time  41  17 ? 43  23  now let us see if we want to take the fiber optic signal to a long distance ; naturally  i mean whatever window you use after some distance depending on the kind of source you are using  the kind of frequency you are using  the quality of fiber you are using  it may be 5 kilometers or it may be 50 kilometers but when you are going thousands of kilometers  at some point of time the signal will become very weak so you need some kind of repeater function what is the repeater ? the incoming signal may amplify or make the shape all right ; so there are all kinds of repeaters repeaters are different gates ; there are some repeaters  which simply amplify the signal there are other repeaters  which can also make corrections to the shape of the incoming signal  etc you need this repeater function in order to go to a very large distance so we will just take a look at this interesting phenomenon  how do you repeat optical signals ? optical signals traveling for long distances through fiber need to be strengthened this may be done through olts ; now what is an olt ? that is optical line transmitter  which takes the signal to the electronic domain and  of course  you can use a fresh source over there to make a nice and strong wave form and push it for the next leg of its journey the important thing is that this may also be done in the optical domain and the advantage of doing it in the optical domain is that you are no longer restricted by the bandwidth limitations of electronics so you can really operate at very high speed always in the optical domain and one way to do that is with  refer slide time  43  24 ? 43  58  erbium doped fiber amplifiers so erbium has a large number of excited states and from some of the excited states it gives out 1550 nanometer light  exactly the wavelength used in the third window in the glass so a few meters of optical fiber are doped ; that means a small quantity of this erbium is introduced in that ; the glass is doped with the few parts per million of erbium and is pumped with 1480 or 980 nanometer laser  to give amplification so what would happen is  refer slide time  43  58 ? 44  39  you look at this suppose this is the ordinary fiber  which is carrying the signal and there is some portion of it which is doped with erbium and a pump laser of certain frequency is fed into this so what will happen is that the erbium atoms in this region will be in an excited state  so erbium will be in a excited state when a signal photon comes  this sort of induces the erbium to come down to the ground state  giving an amplified signal so this is a very simplified version of how erbium doped amplification is used  refer slide time  44  39 ? 44  57  there are other kinds of this ; depending on what kind of pump laser you are using  you may go to this kind of excited state or this kind of excited state from which you can go to excited state one and so on but anyway  the basic idea remains the same  refer slide time  44  57 ? 45  38  because of dispersion  that is chromatic dispersion and polarization  mode dispersion wave shaping is necessary after some distance there are other kinds of combination of wave forms known as solitons ; these are waves shaped specially to match the dispersion characteristics of fiber so that a soliton would not be distorted for a long distance distortion can also be counteracted by reverse fiber so all kinds of technology are there ; we do not have the time to go into the details of these  but this is a very up-coming and growing field  refer slide time  45  38 ? 46  25  once again  why do we like fiber ? ? because repeaters are needed only every 50 to 100 kilometers as opposed may be 2 to 5 kilometers for copper ; not affected by power surges  electromagnetic interference  power failures  corrosive chemicals  etc ; communication in a fiber is usually simplex that means there is the source on one end  receiver on the other end  so in one fiber the data is really going in one direction so for two-way communication  we require a pair of fibers  but these two fibers have more capacity than 1000 strands of twisted pair  and that is really really great  refer slide time  46  27 ? 47  05  we will have just one quick look at where fibers are going ? people are putting fiber at a feverish pitch now one is the ultra long hall ? ultra long hall means we have fiber for a distance of may be thousands of kilometers then in the long hall we have this wdm or sonet  sgas etc  which is put by the telecom company or other communications companies then we have the wdm  atm  sonet  ethernet  etc in the metro  that means  within the same city  and now finally fiber is finding its way in the access side ? that means to individual users also  refer slide time  47  05 ? 47  41  these are the different ways fibers can reach your home  which is the ultimate goal of networking either you can take individual fibers to homes or we can take them to a switch  which is placed in the neighborhood and from there individual fibers go to every home there is also a concept of passive optical networking in that instead of keeping a switch out in the open  you put a passive sort of splitter  which splits the signal into so many parts so pon  passive optical network  is another possibility  refer slide time  47  41 ? 48  22  let us come to the other most important physical medium  namely  wireless one disadvantage of each of the data transmission methods that we have seen so far is that they are all wired connections moving from a wired connection to a wireless connection results in the ability to connect a network without having a physical connection what is the great advantage of that ? the greatest advantage of course is mobility that means if you are connected in a wireless fashion  you can move around but still remain connected  refer slide time  48  22 ? 49  24  this entire electromagnetic spectrum is used for communication this just shows a picture of that on the low end we have the radio  followed by microwave  which is of a higher frequency  followed by infrared  which is of still higher frequency then we have the visible light ; of course we talked about the fiber optics and this part has not been used for communication as yet  may be in future these are the kind of frequencies we have so the frequency range is tremendous ? from 104 or may be 1014 or 1015 or so we have these twisted pairs in this region  coaxial cables  maritime signaling  am radio  fm radio  tv  terrestrial microwave  satellite  fiber optics by the way  radio  and sometimes tv also  terrestrial microwave  satellite are all used for computer communication also  refer slide time  49  24 ? 49  40  these are the different names for the different ranges  we have lf for low frequency  medium frequency  high frequency  very high frequency  ultra high frequency  super high frequency  extremely high frequency  and so on  refer slide time  49  40 ? 50  08  transmitting data  data is transmitted through a wave just as with coax ; that means the higher the frequency  the more the data that can be encoded and transmitted narrow band is often used as the number of watts/hertz is high  and there are different pros and cons at different frequency bands we will just look at some of them  refer slide time  50  08 ? 50  35  sometimes a wide band is used ; using a wide band allows the transmitter to jump from one frequency to another in order to avoid communication jams and to hide detection that is just one example and this is nowadays used in ieee 802.11  which is a wireless lan standard we will look at this later on bluetooth is another wireless lan standard  refer slide time  50  35 ? 51  20  to start at the low end of the spectrum  at the radio transmission  this is very easy to generate  travels long distances and it is omni directional ; that means you have an omni directional antenna and you send your signal over there so it will travel in all directions and it will reach everybody around in a certain area that will not happen if you are using a very high frequency like microwave ; so at low frequencies  waves go to walls and power falls off sharply with distance from the source at high frequencies waves will bounce off of obstacles  refer slide time  51  20 ? 51  34  so there is a limit to the distance that a radio wave can cover vlf  lf  and mf bands are limited by distance on the ground high-frequency and very high-frequency waves can be bounced off the ionosphere  sending it back to earth  which is a very important thing  refer slide time  51  35 ? 52  01  this is a picture of what might happen in short-wave range ? you know the short wave radio ? you can listen to the radio transmission from usa what is happening is that it is getting repeatedly reflected off the ionosphere and reaching the other end of the earth  refer slide time  52  01 ? 52  23  there are problems with this wireless communication ; we will not go into all the details first of all there will be selective kind of attenuation  then there is a very irritating thing called multipath fading so what happens is   refer slide time  52  23 ? 52  47  for example  something like this  your signal may reach directly or your signal may reach through a path after getting reflected somewhere and these two may be out of phase so when they are out of phase  they will sort of cancel each other and you will have a very bad signal these are the problems we encounter in mobile phones  etc so you have to do something about these  refer slide time  52  47 ? 53  21  for microwave transmission  the transmission can be very narrowly focused so data can be moved from one tower to another you may have seen those microwave towers ; so they are sort of in line of sight with each other alignment is important because this is a focused beam if it is not aligned  your receiver will miss the signal altogether beams do not pass through buildings well these are the disadvantages of microwave if the waves are delayed  they may arrive out of sync  which is known as multipath fading  refer slide time  53  21 ? 54  13  finally  we have infrared and millimeter waves at the very high end of these ; of course  we have talked about optical fiber they are mainly used for short-range communication and they are strictly directional as we are going more towards the light  it is becoming more and more directed  as light is very directed so they are directional  cheap  and easy to use but they don ? t pass through solid objects you can not use them for a mobile phone  let us say  but you can use them for controlling your tv or for short-range connection to your computer from some handheld device  etc so this can be an advantage or disadvantage ? one way of looking at it is that since it does not go through walls  whatever you do in one room is going to not affect whatever you are doing in the other room so that may be an advantage also we tried to cover all the different ranges that we use in communication ; we have the satellites also as i mentioned  you have this geostationary satellites  which are nothing but repeaters on the sky  refer slide time  54  36 ? 54  50  so we can sort of send the signal from earth to the satellite  where it will be amplified and sent it back to earth these satellites could be geostationary or the satellites could be sort of low  earth orbiting satellites so they are also used for communication over long distances  refer slide time  55  00 ? 55  10  note  the rest is part of lec 5 faculty name prof sujoy ghosh lecture no # 5 multiplexing  shareing a medium  today we will talk about multiplexing  refer slide  55  27 55  34  multiplexing is about sharing a medium that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  55  42 ? 59  54  another simplest condition a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garble but for multiple signals can share one medium the medium must somehow be divided giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember that a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this band width is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned so what we tried to do is that we tried to use this bandwidth some how to to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers so that is the idea of multiplexing  refer slide time  56  34 ? 56  43  these line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company and most data devices individually the require modest amount of data but when the when a number of users their requirement are aggregated together the sum total may be quite substantial band width  refer slide time  56  55 ? 57  10  the current technique accomplish this includes frequency division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing we will look at many of some of these at least  refer slide time  57  10 57  55  let us see so this is the scheme of multiplexing you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link and on the other side depending on in which fashion you have put them together they started separated in two different lines so these now these different lines in the right they can now go to different recipients so just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here so the so a number of sender receiver pair is utilizing the same physical link in  refer slide time  57  57 ? 58  12  now to for the types of multiplexer as i mentioned that we have fdm that is the frequency division multiplexing  tdm that is the time division multiplexing  stdm that is the statistical time division multiplexing so we will look at these  refer slide time  58  11 ? 58  36  just quickly before we go into get into the details of each of these time division multiplexing each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else so we will look at the details of this later  refer slide time  58  37 ? 58  38  computers networks prof  sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology iit kharagpur lecture  5 multiplexing  sharing a medium   refer slide time  00  53  good day today we will talk about multiplexing  refer slide  00  56  1  08  multiplexing is about sharing a medium ; that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  1  09  2  13  under the simplest condition  a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there  they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garbled ; but for multiple signals to share one medium  the medium must somehow be divided  giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember  a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned we try to use this bandwidth to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers that is the idea of multiplexing there are various reasons we want to use multiplexing   refer slide time  2  15  3  20  and the chief one is that transmission service is very expensive ? leased line  packet switching networks  etc for example  laying of lines is in itself fairly expensive and a complex proposition and once you lay a line you like to utilize it to the maximum if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication  multiplexing and compression techniques are the techniques  which we use for this purpose ? it saves a lot of money for the business when you can send a lot of data through the same line  the data capacity of the line increases  it becomes more cost-effective for the company ; most data devices individually require modest amount of data but when there are a number of users  their requirements are aggregated together and the sum total may be of quite a substantial bandwidth  refer slide time  3  21  3  32  the current techniques that can accomplish this include  frequency division multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing  and code division multiplexing we will look at some of these  at least  refer slide time  3  33  4  19  this is the scheme of multiplexing ; you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side these n inputs have come to the same multiplexer ; they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link and on the other side  depending on the fashion in which you have put them together  they have separated into different lines these different lines on the right can now go to different recipients so just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers  a number of sender ? receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in-between  refer slide time  4  20  5  01  the alternative to multiplexing should be direct point-to-point connection ; this has a number of problems the first problem is that you need those lines that we were talking about  you need lines for each device  and you need a large amount of wiring  if they are on different floors another important point is that you need a lot of i/o ports on the computer side  which really is not feasible you may have a few i/o ports  but you can not have hundreds of i/o ports  it ? s really difficult to have hundreds of i/o ports there that is also another bottleneck that we wish to address  refer slide time  5  02  5  22  another approach could be  a somewhat older approach  which is that of a multi-drop line the host polls machines to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines  saves i/o port ; the total communications load is not greater than the data rate of line  refer slide time  5  23  5  42  these are actually the simple approaches using a multiplexer approach  all the devices  their data is multiplexed on one side  sent through one line  and the number of lines in is equal to the number of lines out ; the link carries multiple channels of information  refer slide time  5  43  5  59  the types of multiplexer we have are  fdm  that is  frequency division multiplexing ; tdm  that is  time division multiplexing ; stdm  that is  statistical time division multiplexing we will look at these  refer slide time  6  0  6  26  just quickly before we get into the details of each of these  in time-division multiplexing  each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time  for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else ? s time we will look at the details of this later  refer slide time  6  26  6  51  another common approach is the frequency division multiplexing ; here the frequency spectrum is divided among the logical channels here we have only one physical channel  but we want to have a number of logical channels  so the frequency spectrum of the channel is divided  each user has exclusive access to his channel  refer slide time  6  52  8  52  this fdm sends signals in several distinct frequency ranges  one of the oldest uses of frequency division multiplexing is in radio for example  we have this electromagnetic field in our atmosphere  let us say  through which electromagnetic radiation can pass electromagnetic radiation can be of very large range of bandwidth  the whole range of bandwidth is there out of that  the so-called radio frequencies constitute one part of it  a fairly important part of it this whole bandwidth of radio frequencies is divided into small channels and each channel is given to one particular station and on the receiver side  on the radio side  what we do is that we tune our radio  let us say  to one particular frequency  so that it receives signal from that particular station only ; although a number of stations are all transmitting at the same time this is an example of multiplexing another example of multiplexing  the same frequency division multiplexing  we see nowadays in the cable tv the cable tv providers give one cable  one coaxial cable to the premise connected to the tv that one coaxial cable apparently is carrying a number of channels  may be hundreds of channels these days what is done once again is that  all the frequencies  which can travel down this cable  are broken into a number of logical channels and each channel is dedicated to one particular station that is how we carry multiple video channels on a single cable  refer slide time  8  53  10  10  of course i mean point-to-point is out of question imagine the cost of stringing wire for each channel ; you ? ll have a hundred cables coming into your building which is not really possible each signal is modulated on to a different carrier frequency ; carrier frequencies are separated by guard bands this guard band is important because one particular channel  maybe a radio channel or a tv channel  the principle is the same everywhere so  that uses some middle frequency  maybe some range of frequencies the next station maybe a tv station or a radio station ? whatever it is  that can occupy ; first of all that has to be non-overlapping the range of frequencies which is assigned to the second station has to be non-overlapping with the range of frequencies which is given to the first station and not only that  between these two there must be some separation in frequencies otherwise what will happen is these two signals are going to interfere with each other so that is a guard band  refer slide time  10  11  10  17  the bandwidth of the transmission medium exceeds required bandwidth of all signals because of these guard bands which have to come in-between  refer slide time  10  18  11  02  usually for frequency division multiplexing  analog signaling is used to transmit signals broadcast radio and television  cable television and amps cellular phone system use frequency division multiplexing amps is an old cellular phone system that was there in usa nowadays of course  the kind of cellular technology that we have in our country uses more complex multiplexing techniques  maybe i ? ll mention that later on these systems all use frequency division multiplexing this technique is the oldest of the multiplexing techniques  refer slide time  11  03  11  22  assignment of non-overlapping frequency ranges to each user or signal on a medium ? all signals are transmitted at the same time  each using different frequencies a multiplexer accepts inputs and assigns frequencies to each device  refer slide time  11  21  12  07  the multiplexer is attached to a high-speed communications line because all these frequency bands on individual users are going to adapt to a fat range of frequencies the communication line must be able to handle this whole frequency range or in other words  the communication line has to be high speed a corresponding multiplexer or demultiplexer is on the end of the high-speed line and separates the multiplexed signals  because on the other end you have to separate them out since it involves analog signaling  it is more susceptible to noise thus we have seen that the analog signals are more susceptible to noise in digital signals we can sort of clean the noise more easily  refer slide time  12  08  12  52  this is a diagram if you note that for a particular user  suppose user 1  we give channel 1 ; along the time this channel 1 is entirely dedicated to user 1 for all time similarly channel 2  which is at a different frequency ? frequency is on this side and time is on this side ? once again user 2 gets to use this frequency for the whole time this is the simplest kind of scheme  so that for this whole frequency band  frequency is being divided  which is why it is called frequency division multiplexing  refer slide time  12  52  13  13  as was mentioned  the frequency channel is divided into logical channels ; each user hangs on to a particular frequency  the radio spectrum and a radio are examples of the media and the mechanism of extending information from the media  refer slide time  13  13  12  07  this is another picture of the same thing  see channel 1 and then channel 2  channel 3 ? they all send some signals if you plot them across the frequency versus the signal strength  you get a picture like this  so this is the first channel  this is the second channel and this is the third channel in-between this part here is the so-called guard band this frequency is not used by either of them there is some overlapping due to noise and other issues ; we will not get into that ; due to that this is what it looks like  the frequency bands are all separated  refer slide time  14  05  14  47  here is another diagram which shows  let ? s say you have the host and a 300 bps line ; a number of 300 bits per second lines are being multiplexed to 1200 bps line and then there are some guard bands  maybe 300 to 1013 hz is one and then 1433 to 2206 hz is another line ; maybe 2686 to 3400 hz is another line these are the 300 bps sub-channels and you have the guard bands in-between on the other side again you have this multiplexer ? demultiplexer  which takes it to different users  refer slide time  14  48  15  35  one problem with fdm is that it can not utilize the full capacity of the cable it is important that the frequency bands do not overlap so that is why you have to give the guard bands  so the full capacity of the cable is not utilized the other disadvantage ? we will summarize these advantages and disadvantages later on ? is that it is sort of bit more prone to noise because we are dealing with analog signals fdm is usually used to carry analog signals although modulated digital signals can also be sent using this technique  refer slide time  15  35  16  22  we have another type of multiplexing  which is wavelength division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing is the same as the frequency division multiplexing only thing is that here the operating frequencies are much higher  actually they are in the optical range ; that is why somehow it is given different name like wavelength division multiplexing  you know different wavelengths means different frequencies if you are doing wavelength division it is same as doing frequency division and this is used in optical fibers this is the same as fdm but applied to fibers  refer slide time  16  23  17  08  there ? s a great potential for fibers since the bandwidth is very huge as i mentioned  the operating frequencies are very high  even a slight percentage diviation from the mean operating frequency gives you a very large bandwidth so you can sort of compact or pack a lot of channels at those high frequencies fibers have a large bandwidth capacity and with different energy bands are passed through a diffraction grating prism combined on the long distant link and then split at the destination this is got high reliability as well as high capacity  two very interesting properties  refer slide time  17  08  18  23  so multiplexing and demultiplexing for a wavelength division multiplexing is of course very simple if you take a prism  you know if you send a white light through a prism it breaks up into all the different colours  because the refractive index of the prism varies with the frequency so different frequency can come in  you can make the same light source also to say in this and on the other side you can use a prism to break it up of course i have shown a prism here for simplicity ; usually something like a diffraction grating is used so if you look at the fiber spectrum  if you plot the power versus the frequency so one fiber maybe giving at this frequency  another fiber maybe delivering power at this frequency if you put them together simply then you get this power versus ? or power versus ?  kind of plot that you get  refer slide time  18  24  19  37  wavelength division multiplexing multiplexes multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic line different wavelength lasers called ? s ; traditionally ? is used for denoting a wavelength  some are quite extensively used in this optical communication domain different frequencies are called different ? s and they transmit multiple signals each signal carried on the fiber can be transmitted at a different rate from the other signals this is one very interesting thing of fiber that is  different colours although they may get mixed but finally again they will be separated what rate of data  what protocol etc are they carrying ? the fiber system is really transparent to all that so that is a good thing ? different systems can be put to the same fiber as i mentioned that fiber have a very high capacity so you get to push in a lot of channels into the same fiber  refer slide time  19  39  21  09  dense wavelength division multiplexing also called dwdm they may combine as many as 30  40  50  60 or more channels these days into one fiber and each of these channels has a very high capacity ; so dwdm channel has a very high capacity and it is improving all the time people are finding ways of packing more ? s into the same fiber and it is supposed to be quite scalable into the future ; but of course if you want to pack those wavelengths in a very dense fashion  your equipment becomes somewhat costly a cheaper alternative which has come up recently which are called cwdm so dense wavelength division multiplexing is called dwdm  cheaper version is called coarse wavelength division multiplexing or cwdm in this cwdm the channels are more widely spaced on the spectrum multiplexer  demultiplexer  and all these costs go down and become cheaper alternatives but still you can push in a number of wavelengths into the same fiber now we come to the other very important multiplexing technique called time division multiplexing  refer slide time  21  10  22  10  as a matter of fact this is extensively used in our computer communication or telecommunication time division multiplexing is very extensively used especially on the service provider side ; we will look at these later on sharing of the signal is accomplished in time division multiplexing by dividing the available transmission time on a medium among users ; so time is being divided what is done is that  as i mentioned before  that each user gets a small burst of time in which at that time the entire channel and the entire bandwidth is at his disposal ; but as soon as that short duration of time is over  then it is somebody else ? s turn to send and this maybe in a round-robin fashion after some time it will come back to the original user  so that he can send his next burst of data or voice or whatever it is  refer slide time  22  12  22  40  usually we use digital signaling in time division multiplexing  almost always digital signaling is used almost exclusively time division multiplexing comes in two basic forms  one is synchronous time division multiplexing  the other is statistical or asynchronous time division multiplexing we will look at synchronous time division multiplexing first and because that is the simpler scheme and then you will look at statistical multiplexing  refer slide time  22  41  23  42  so the same multiplexing scheme now looks like this if this is the frequency  the same plot if you remember in the previous diagram when we were doing tdm we were slicing this channel in this fashion we are now slicing it in this fashion ; that means time is divided ; channel 1 channel 2  channel 3  channel 4  channel 5  channel 6 ; they get the entire frequency range for a small burst of time and suppose only 6 channels are being multiplexed  after 6 again it will be the turn of channel 1 so channel 1 sends the first burst of data etc using the entire frequency band during this time period and then during this time period during this time channel 1 is not sending anything so it is quiescent time is getting divided in this fashion  this is why this is called time division multiplexing  refer slide time  23  45  25  23  this is a schematic of a time division multiplexing system like fdm time division multiplexing saves money by allowing more than one telephone call to use a cable at the same time you have terminal 1  terminal 2 and terminal 3 terminal 1 is giving at this particular time then terminal 2 and this terminal 3 and over here on the other side this sequence and the way it goes that is known that has to be known ; so whatever signal comes at one particular slot ; this multiplexer knows that this must be for receiver number 1 and next slot is for receiver number 2 and next slot for receiver number 3 so on the receiver side  it just knows if it is this time slot  it is for a particular user this is a synchronous division multiplexing because this clock and this clock have to be synchronized otherwise  there will be a problem instead of dividing the cable frequency bands  tdm splits cable usage into time slots each channel is given a regular time slot in which to send a pcm signal  refer slide time  25  25  27  41  this is another view of the same time division multiplexing actually in actual practice  we will go into the details of this later on actually this time division multiplexing can be done in a hierarchy of manner we will look at this hierarchy later on if you remember from our digital signals discussion  that our voice  because it is up to say 4 khz is our voice signal  because of nyquist theorem  we require 8 kilo samples ; that means double the rate  that means 8,000 samples/second for capturing voice and for each sample  it has to be converted each sample is an analog value ; so that value has to be converted to a digital signal  an 8 bit digital signal  which is called pcm ? pulse coded modulation that means there are 256 different levels that this is distributing  which is very fine our amplitude of voice if you divide it into 256 parts we are making a very fine distinction ; that gives you 8 bits per sample 8,000 samples/second ; that comes to 64,000 bits per/second this is a very basic rate and this rate has got a name ; we will go to these names later on a number of such channels may be multiplexed together this 64,000 bits/second is a very basic rate a number of such channels may be grouped together to form one particular higher level channel and different higher lever channels may again join together to make a hierarchy of channels  this is what is shown over here  refer slide time  27  41  28  38  these t1 etc  don ? t bother about this figure at this moment because we will look at this later on so t1 is one particular rate at which some of these signals come there are world wide standards actually there are two standards  we will talk about it later on standards of the rate at which these signals come ; they sort of join together and form a stream of t2 stream and different t2 streams  different waves have different names like t1  t2  t3  etc  will form a t3 kind of frame and as you can see that the bandwidth is increasing all the time the t1 rate is 1.544 mb/second  refer slide time  28  38  32  10  time division multiplexing used for digital signals or analog signals carrying digital data  data rate of transmission media exceeds data rate of signals ; so this has to be there otherwise your tdm system will not work because in that small burst of time which is given to a particular user  in that burst of time that user should be able to send whatever digital data it had accumulated during that time  as well as the previous epoch during which it was quiescent ; because at that time it was other people ? s turn it may be a buffer or kind of thing where all these bits are getting accumulated and when it gets its small burst of time  during that burst of time it sends all the bits in that buffer  to make it empty and then it becomes quite again  so it will accumulate the bits again in the buffer and then again when it gets the next burst of time it will send all the bits thus data rate of transmission media has to exceed data rate of signals it uses a frame ; frame means a number of bits and bytes put together to form one particular unit at which to send it over ; one slot for each slice of time what would happen is that a slow device during his slot will send a lower number of bits ; very high-speed device will send a large number of bits  but your slot will come periodically one or more slots of each device is equal to channel and time slots are transmitted whether source has data or not this is one particular problem with time division multiplexing think about this ? that on the receiving side  receiver side is blind ; it does not know this stream of bits which has come is for whom the only way he knows that this is the time slot for receiver i  so he will send those bits to receiver i and so on in a round robin fashion what happens is  suppose the senders are s1  s2 to sn  receivers are also s1  s2 to sn ; and then we have this the si will be sending to ri ; what happens if si has nothing to send at that point of time ? during that time it is not possible for the multiplexer or the demultiplexer  in the normal scheme of things  to send somebody else maybe sj ? s signal during that time although physically it would be possible ; but then on the demultiplexing side it would cause a problem because the demultiplexer would not know whether this bit is for ri or rj that is why even if si has nothing to send  that slot will have to run empty ; you can not utilize it any further this is the weakness of time division multiplexing which we try to sort of address in a different scheme  we will be talking about just now  refer slide time  32  11  32  33  the synchronous time division multiplexing  remember that it is synchronous because the multiplexer and the demultiplexer has to agree about the slot of time ; the original time division multiplexing  the multiplexer accepts input from attached devices in a round robin fashion and transmit t1 and isdn telephone lines are common examples of synchronous time division multiplexing  refer slide time  32  34  33  01  if one device generates data at a faster rate than other devices  then the multiplexer must either sample the incoming data stream from that device more often than it samples the other devices or buffer the faster incoming stream if a device has nothing to transmit the multiplexer must still insert a piece of data from that device into the multiplexed stream  it may be a dummy data  refer slide time  33  02  34  08  before i talk about the other kind of tdm  which is the statistical time division multiplexing  i must mention that there are hybrid multiplexing schemes also that means in the hybrid scheme  what you do is that you take a frequency band ; it is like frequency division multiplexing  so you break up your entire available channels into a number of bands ; but each of the bands instead of in the pure fdm  we are giving it to only one user but this band is allotted to may be a number of users who use tdm on this band this is a combination of fdm and tdm  so such kind of hybrid multiplexing systems are quite widely used in these days and one good example is the cell phone communication that goes on ; that may use hybrid kind of multiplexing systems  refer slide time  34  10  34  21  in hybrid multiplexing system  both fdm and tdm may be combined ; the available channel is broken up into frequency bands ; in each band multiple channels are accommodated through tdm  refer slide time  34  22  36  38  now we talk about the other kind of time division multiplexing  namely  statistical multiplexing this is time division but on demand rather than fixed  so we reschedule link on a per packet basis and packets from different sources are interweaved on the link remember that i mentioned the disadvantage of time division multiplexing is that even if the sender does not have to send anything  that time slot will go empty we can not utilize it because otherwise on the demultiplexer side we will not be able to decipher who it is in the pure time division multiplexing this is to be addressed in statistical time division multiplexing or stdm ; what is done is that the packets are sent on demand ; that means if somebody has to send and the channel is free  it will be sent of course if everybody has to send  then you have to once again do some kind of scheduling in a round robin fashion in a simple vanilla case or you can do more fancy kind of scheduling i am not going into that so this utilizes the channel in a much more efficient manner ; but you have a problem we know what the problem is ? the problem is on the demultiplexer side on the demultiplexer side  one particular time slot being allotted to one particular sender or a receiver  that relationship is no longer there  and if that relationship is no longer there  how do we make out on the other side whether this is meant for whom ? so you have to have that address inside that data stream that means inside the data stream  there must be something which tells the receiver and the demultiplexer that this is meant for that receiver so you have to have the address  at least the destination address in the packet so to say  now i am calling it a packet that what ever the burst of data sent in a particular time slot  refer slide time  36  41  38  20  it allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit how is this possible ? this is because usually our communication is always bursting  for example  when i am talking i may require 4 khz  when i am making a sound ; but then there are periods when i am quiescent that means i ? m not talking at all .so overall if i can utilize that  maybe my effective rate of utilization of the channel will become more than 4 khz ; because one user is using 4 khz and this way in each of the channels  the same thing happens and much more dramatically  in the world of sending and receiving data data traffic is inherently bursting  which means that one computer is communicating with other computer  this will do so in bursts it will want to send a lot of stuff ; suddenly it has something to send  so it will want to send it fast in a burst then for a long time it will be quiet  as there will be nothing because it will go there  maybe get processed over there  maybe some user sees it  sees that data  and things like that so it is quiet for a long time  then again it sends another burst and in-between these bursts there is a lot of time while the burst is there  i am using at a very high speed but then other people can share it  so that is why in some sense it allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit  refer slide time  38  21  39  00  this works on the premise that not all nodes will transmit at full capacity at all times ; must transmit a terminal identification  as i said the destination identification has to be there ; and may require storage because two different sources may want to send at the same time and both of them land up hoping that the channel will be free i am calling it a multiplexer at this point  at the multiplexer end you have to store them and then forward them over the channels  and then the channel becomes available  refer slide time  39  01  39  56  this is a picture of once again getting multiplexed ? they are getting multiplexed as they come this is the queue in-between and you have this buffer over here  this is the memory where the incoming packets are getting stored and they are making a queue so there are a number of packets here and from this queue one by one as they come  it is not necessary that they have to go in a strict round robin fashion ; as they arrive they have are being pumped into this transmission channel on this side  on the demultiplexing side  it will look at some receiver address which is contained within this packet or cell  whatever it is  and then send it to the proper receiver  refer slide time  39  57  40  47  the buffer packets that are contending for the link  the packet queue may be processed first in and out  but as i said this is the most vanilla kind of scheme ; there are other fancy schemes for example you may have a high-priority queue for some of the users who may be paying more ? that queue is processed first before the other queues and all kinds of possibilities are there but of course since you have a buffer  it is theoretically possible and since your capacity of the link can not handle if all the senders decide to send at the same time  which may happen  in which case it will be filling it in the buffer  but the buffer may also overflow  which means that there is a congestion in the network and then some data loss is there  refer slide time  40  48  41  16  to summarize  a statistical multiplexer transmits only the data from active work stations if a work station is not active  no space is wasted on the multiplexed stream ; a statistical multiplexer accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame containing only the data to be transmitted and also as i said this frame will also contain the some kind of destination address  refer slide time   41  16  45  41  this is an example to identify each piece of data and the address is included so the data of c as well as address of c  data of a as well as address of a ? the address also has to go with the data this of course is under the assumption that all these data packets and these addresses  together all these packet lengths are fixed  which is the case in some systems like atm  etc the size is fixed but the size may vary also  if the size varies then you will have to include the length of a also  that means this is the data of a ; what is the total length of a or maybe the data part  if this part is fixed depending on the scheme then the address to which this is destined all these are put in the form of a frame and then it is sent finally i would like to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each of the schemes by the way  in the beginning i mentioned something called code division multiplexing  which is a very interesting scheme we will talk about code division multiplexing when we talk about multiple access there are actually two terms ; one is multiplexing and the other is multiple access usually this is how we mean it but distinction is getting blurred these days ; usually when you are multiplexing  the sources are sort of converged to the multiplexer in some sense the sources are converged to the multiplexer in some sense and it goes to the demultiplexer where it diverges there is a specific convergence which is there  that means a number of telephone lines are getting multiplexed ; a number of telephone lines will come to the local telephone exchange there these may be all destined for some other exchange  so all these lines will be multiplexed together so they are happening physically in one place if the problem is this  then once again you have a shared medium but the users are distributed in that case we call it a multiple access system cdma is a multiple access system as well as you can in some sense call it a multiplexing system also as i said this distinction is slowly getting blurred these days ; for example  you are doing some kind of multiplexing when you come to cell phones we are doing some hybrid kind of multiplexing ; that means we have got a combination of fdm and tdm ; i.e  we have some bands of frequencies which are being used by a number of users ; but these users are not at the same place they are carrying some wireless station that means they are carrying their mobile handsets and are at various locations even for the same base station  under the same base station  they are at various locations in that area so to say thus the distinction between multiplexing and multiple access is getting a little blurred these days anyway we will discuss code division multiplexing or multiple access when we talk about other kinds of multiple access as you can guess  there is time division multiple access and then there is frequency division multiple access and then of course this code division multiple access is also there ; so we will discuss it there  refer slide time  45  43  48  20  coming back to the scheme that we discussed  namely  fdm  what are the advantages and good things about each of these schemes ? fdm is of course simple and being simple means that it is cheap and is very popular  and as i mentioned this is the oldest multiplexing technique your radio uses this and lots of other systems use this tdm is specifically for digital signals  so for digital signals tdm is very nice and then you can have a multiplexing hierarchy ; that is another advantage of tdm why it is an advantage ? well the advantage is because of this  at different places we may require different levels of bandwidth and speed just think about this ? suppose we have this telephone network  you may have a small exchange ; the small exchange will naturally have a small number of users and only a few of those users will want to communicate or make an std call or to communicate with some other telephone  which is under some other exchange so the few will have to be multiplexed together at the small exchange and it will be sent to the trunk exchange and from there it may go to another trunk exchange and so on and finally reach at the trunk exchange what is happening is that once again various such connections from different local exchanges are coming and converging to the same trunk exchange when this trunk exchange is communicating with another big trunk exchange  what is happening is that there are a lot of tributaries flowing into it  there are a lot of channels so basically in the same signal  we are doing time division multiplexing that means the rate at which the receiver at this end is sending  that same rate has to be maintained throughout ; but then instead of flowing in small tributaries  it is moved into a very fat channel we require a multiplexing hierarchy so such multiplexing hierarchies are easy to implement using time division multiplexing ; we will see more of this when we talk about synchronous digital hierarchy later on  refer slide time  48  21  50  47  stdm ? s advantages  we are only talking about advantages we will talk about disadvantages later on in statistical time division multiplexing  this has certainly more efficient bandwidth use it is much more efficient because as i mentioned  that specially data usage and usage in general may be very bursty and if it is bursty  then during the quiescent period  ordinary tdm is just wasting the channel whereas stdm is making full use of it so it has more efficient bandwidth use ; that is a good thing about stdm another advantage of stdm is that the frame can contain control information ; since you are putting a frame  may be with the address of the receiver or may be other kinds of control information can be put in the frame and then  the packets can be of varying sizes these are the advantages of stdm ; not all stdm systems will allow this varying sizes ; for example  atm will not allow varying size cells in atm  the packets are called cells  they will have a fixed size but some systems may allow wdm  we are writing it separately because although as i said this is some form of fdm  this works with a very high capacity  is scalable  and this has got low noise sensitivity that is another good thing about the communication in the optical domain suppose you are doing it in a electrical domain through a wire  may be  if there is some kind of electrical noise  somewhere some motor has started or very bad if there is some lightning somewhere nearby  lot of noise will get into it and this electrical wire will catch all this noise whereas an optical fiber is not going to catch any of these noises  it is very immune to noise  which is why it ? s got a very low noise sensitivity  which is very good and very high capacity and you can scale it to still higher capacity using dwdm  refer slide time  50  48  51  20  just a quick look at the disadvantages  fdm  as i mentioned earlier  is susceptible to noise  wasted bandwidth  because of this guard band  etc  and of course one frequency is whatever the small band is being permanently given to one user and if his usage is very bursty  then a lot of bandwidth is wasted then  we have a limited frequency range in tdm we have wasted bandwidth for the same reason  refer slide time  51  21  52  06  stdm takes care of that problem in a tdm but this is very expensive ; traditionally we did not have any other alternative so we used stdm a lot when high speed was necessary especially in the service provider side  we used stdm wdm is somewhat more costly than tdm and fdm but since this is a developing technology  this cost is coming down and that means the wdm cost is coming down but it is still somewhat more costly than tdm and fdm but may be less costly than stdm we have looked at the different multiplexing techniques today ; in the next lecture we will look at one kind of network  which is very widely used for data and all kinds of communication  namely  the telecom network  the telecommunication network because remember that although it is called telecommunication network and it was traditionally for people talking over telephones  for voice  etc  that is the network which carries most of the wide area data traffic today  and that is a very important we will talk about it in the next lecture preview of next lecture computers networks prof  sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology iit kharagpur lecture  6 telecom networks  refer slide time  52  52  today we will talk about telecom networks  means the kind of network that is used by telephones and of course it is by host of other things as we will discuss this telecom network is very important in the sense that first of all  it is one of the earliest network that we had and that is one thing that is quite old and secondly  the telecom network even today is mostly used for a wide area communication comparatively  we have much fewer  i mean entirely or exclusive data networks we will look at the evolution of telecom networks  refer slide time  53  54-55  29  well when alexander graham bell developed the first telephone  it was a couple of telephone instruments connected by wire now if you are trying to connect more than one people that means more than one subscribers are there ; taking this principle forward you will have to connect everybody to everybody else through a wire which of course becomes very unwieldy very soon ; because connecting or stringing a wire between every pair of telephones  that might want to communicate was not a good long term strategy at all as you can see that very soon we ? ll have veritable jungle of wires and of course its costly and it is very difficult to manage at the subscriber end you can not handle so many wires coming into your premise  so better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office there an operator could connect one telephone to another via switchboard that is the next figure  you see that the number of wires have come down as a matter of fact in the figure at the top if you have n subscribers  naturally you have n  n -1  / 2 links which is approximately n2 kind of links whereas in the latter case you have only n links so the number of links as n becomes large  and you know today there are so many telephone subscribers so there is no question of connecting them individually  you have to connect them to a central switching office  refer slide time  55  46-56  59  even then once  again i mentioned this earlier in the lecturer  you must remember that it is not that we have a whole parallel network for data from computers etc all over the globe  it is not there the telecom network has been around for a long time it had a long and very excellent history so that is why even today most of the wide area network traffic still rides on this telecom network originally it might have been a packet then it might be sort of made into some kind of a session for which there is some part of the connection is dedicated and all kinds of technology has come in but even today most of the wide area networks are based on the telecom networks and telecom  that is one side of the story  the other side of the story is that telecom networks the telecom people are actually in the process of routing some of the voice calls and may be some of the other kinds of calls into this packet kind of technology  refer slide time  57  00-57  22  so dsl at subscriber end voice traffic is transmitted as standard analog telephony signals ; data traffic is transmitted over the same line via a dsl modem that transmits the data as high frequency digital broadband signals on the same line if you have dsl modem you can have both your voice as well as data at the same time  unlike very ordinary analog lines  refer slide time  57  23-57  35  so dsl at the central office end  co end  and the signal passes through a splitter as i have shown and a local loop management system the subscriber line access multiplexer is there in this figure  refer slide time  57  36-57  39  we have already seen  refer slide time  57  40-57  43  in this figure  we have dslam and the loop management over there   refer slide time  57  44-57  59  the broadband digital signals are directed to a dslam that terminates and coordinates traffic from multiple local loop lines from the dslam  the traffic is sent to a router and then to the internet and finally we have the loop management system   refer slide time  58  02-58  24  which may be in front of the splitter  or behind the splitter this comes to various functions like giving the connections and testing and all this service kind of testing are done through the local loop management thank you computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh lecture # 2 network topology  refer slide time  00  53  good day in this lecture we will discuss the network topology what do you mean by a network topology ?  slide reference time  01  04  01  14   refer slide time  01  15  02  33  we can just have a quick recap of what we have learnt last time basically a computer network could be a number of nodes  which are connected by some communication links there is some kind of what we usually call a graph representing the network this graph has a certain structure we talk about the structure this structure has an implication about how will we communicate i said it is in general not feasible to have one-to-one communication between each pair of node that is not possible at all so  we need a structure formed by the nodes connected in some manner that is the subject matter of discussion today so a network may be represented as a graph nodes may represent computer or network devices like switches  routers  etc and the links represent communication links modes of communication may be broadcast or point to point  refer slide time  02  34  02  49  first let us talk about the lan topologies lan is the local area network and local area network topologies are  star  ring and bus we will just look at all of them  refer slide time  02  59  04  30  we first take up this bus topology as this is a very simple kind of network this is based on a shared broadcast link we want to have point-to-point communication there may be so many nodes a  b  c  d etc  which are connected to the network a wants to communicate to b ; a specifically wants to communicate to b so each pair of communicating nodes uses the link for the short time so a uses the link for the short time to send his message to b after that is over may be c might send something to d or something like that so other nodes ignore the communication since this is shared broadcast link  all the links are shared by all the nodes for the communication hence that is not private in that sense so all the nodes get that communication but they usually ignore this communication whereas b will copy this for its own purpose there has to be a distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link ; otherwise  communications will collide in that shared broadcast medium the communication of both the pairs of node will get garbled but we want a  b and c  d to get clear signal so there has to be some distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link  refer slide time  05  12  05  59  now let us see bus topology what do we require ? the simplest thing is a single cable a single cable connects all the computers it is as if the computers are hanging from the single cable each computer is connected to this shared cable so computers must synchronize and allow only one computer to transmit at a time as per a protocol but as such  the network is very simple network with a single copper cable  refer slide time  06  00  06  26  so this is the picture of a bus we have this shared cable and computers are somehow connected to this so a will communicate to b b will simply broadcast over this medium b will capture it c  d  e  etc will all ignore this  refer slide time  06  27  08  25  the network is maintained by the single cable cable segment must end with a terminator otherwise  what will happen is that when some node  let us say a sends a signal on the cable not only c  d  etc will get it but it will get reflected from that other end if it is not properly terminated so it becomes a kind of unwanted noise in the medium which we do not want so the coaxial cable is used there are two types of coaxial cables traditionally used one is a thin coaxial cable called thin lan and the thick coaxial cable called thick lan and extra stations can be added in a daisy chain manner this technology is sort of getting outdated at the moment you still have maybe some thin and thick lans here and there but mostly people are moving out of this and the main reason why the people are moving out of this is because this connection is likely to become loose and as soon as you have a loose connection you will have a problem in communication there are some other reasons also why this technology has become obsolete these days but still if you have shared medium  i mean the technology of using a single cable with a single broadcast medium and some machines are sharing so this something like a bus topology  refer slide time  08  26  10  23  the standard which is used on this bus topology is ieee 802.3 actually what we do is to eliminate that cable and replace with something else we will discuss that later thin ethernet is the name of the technology when we use thin coaxial cable ? we call it 10base2 in this 10 stands for that it has a 10 mbps speed whereas 2 stands for the maximum range of segment length of 200 meters the maximum number of connections is about 30 devices four repeaters may be used to a total cable length of 1000 meters if you want to have a very long cable  what will happen is that  as the signal travels down the line  the signal will get weak and as the signal gets weak you have to regenerate the signal and one way to regenerate the signal is to use a repeater over there the repeater will simply take the incoming weak signal  amplify it and send the stronger signal down the line the maximum number of nodes that you can handle here is about 150  refer slide time  10  24  11  03  thick ethernet  which is the other version where you use a thick coaxial cable called 10base5  also has the same speed of 10 megabits per second but length up to 500 meters so they were used for backbones that are limited to 500 meters with a maximum of 100 nodes per segment that is somewhat more than a thin net and a total of four repeaters of 2500 meters that is also somewhat more than thin net  refer slide time  11  05  12  42  now the bus topology has both advantages and disadvantages it is very inexpensive as you have a simple cable it is easy to add stations you can have another punch on this cable and add new station that means a new computer the amount of cable it uses is also much less and may be  it works well for very small networks it is of course no longer recommended which means you will not get these parts any longer it is getting out of fashion because it is unreliable this is much less reliable than the technology that we have today the other disadvantage is that the limited number of devices that can be attached it is difficult to isolate the problems if there is a problem  then the whole network is down sharing the same cable slows the response rates  refer slide time  12  43  13  30  now we come to direct point-to-point communication that means this is not shared so this is some kind of a dedicated point-to-point communication so computers are connected by communication channels that each connect exactly two computers they are dedicated for this pair so this forms either a mesh or a point-to-point communication  and thus a complete graph we will come to that later this is some point-to-point network that means there is a dedicated link between some pairs of nodes it allows flexibility in communication  hardware  and packet formats and also provides security and privacy because communication channels are not shared  refer slide time  13  52  14  25  with point-to-point network  the network will look somewhat like this we have these two nodes or three nodes may be connected like this if we have four nodes and we want to interconnect everybody then we require six such cables as the number of nodes goes to n the number of cables you require is going to be nc2 which is n  n ? 1  /2 which is approximately equal to n2 which means the number of cables and the total length of cables that is involved are really increasing but the kind of cable which is usually used is not as expensive as the previous thin lan or the thick lan at the same time the amount of cable that you require becomes very high hence this kind of structure is not really recommended for a local area network suppose you have  say  10 nodes in a network and you are connecting everything to everything that means every node to every other node and length of the cable for some reason  let us say  is not an issue but then each node will be connected to 9 other nodes this means that in this particular computer you will require 9 ports to which these cables will be connected but that is not so easy to provide and this is another reason why  in a local area network  this kind of mesh topology is not recommended we have an alternative for that  refer slide time  15  55  16  02  we are coming to that alternative another reason why you can not connect everybody to everybody else can be illustrated thus  suppose there are two different buildings now the length of the cable will really become enormous because if you have n cables on one side and m cables  n nodes on one side and m nodes on the other side  you have a total of m ? n number of cables which are running between two different buildings it is lot of cables really so if we want to reduce the number of communication channels we have to  refer slide time  16  34  17  18  basically give up the idea of communicating directly in a lan it means that necessarily we share the connections among many computers there are ways of doing this by multiplexing here the computer takes turns in a very orderly fashion that is called time division multiplexing and it also must include some technique for synchronizing the use that means whoever wants to use that shared channel has to wait for his turn  refer slide time  16  34-17.18  we now come to this other topology  which is very common these days it is star topology a star topology looks like this there is a central hub  the centre of the wheel is called a hub  and a number of nodes are connected to this hub i may at this stage mention that there is a physical topology and a logical topology this is a star topology because it looks like a star its physical topology is that it looks like a star sometimes the hub is made in such a way that still this is a shared medium what is the advantage of converting to what was previously a bus ? it has some practical utility in the sense that  although the length of the cable is more in this case  the cable is a different kind of cable the cable connections are much better they do not get disconnected very often furthermore when you bring all the connections together centrally  you can handle the connections at one central point whereas  if you have a long running cable  it will be difficult to locate loose connections we will have to find out failures by going around so that becomes a bit difficult so the physical star topology still maintains a logical bus topology  which is an important thing otherwise this hub or the central node may not be a shared medium at all this is often the case these days  refer slide time  19  49  20  49  of course the previous star diagram is idealized usually you will have something like this you have this hub somewhere and then you have these different computers connected and there is a number which is written over here  rj-45 connector which is the kind of connection which has become almost ubiquitous these cables are something like the kind of cables which connect your telephones they are called utp cables or unshielded twisted pair cables they are basically easier to handle and are also cheaper these connections go on to the rj-45 connectors on both sides they are much more reliable than the previous thin lan or thick lan but the physical diagram may look something like this  refer slide time  20  50  21  36  you can have an extended star topology  which means different stars may be there  which are connected in some manner that means the hubs in those stars are connected and those hubs may be shared but may not be shared medium at all they may be what are known as switches these switches are connected if you look at this diagram  you have these different switches and from each switch we have a star connection to the different computers and the switches are connected in some fashion you can call this also as a star this is called extended star topology  refer slide time  20  50-21  36  you may have a hybrid topology some part of the network may be on a shared medium some part  maybe  is not shared and even in some part  you could also have a coaxial cable running  leaving a thin lan or thick lan although that is becoming less common these days  refer slide time  22  04  23  03  now we come to another topology  which is also very important topology  called as ring topology in ring topology  computers are connected in a closed loop this has a lot of advantage the way it works is that the first node passes the data to the second node ; the second one passes the data to the third and so on the data will go on hopping around the ring and what will happen is that  as it reaches the destination  if it will go around in a loop  it will surely reach the destination at some point of time the destination will copy the same in practice there is a short connected cable from the computer to the ring ring connections may run past offices with connector cables to sockets in the offices  refer slide time  23  04  25  45  this is an example of a ring topology actually  there are two rings in a ring the data will always go in only one direction if your destination is on the wrong side then the data has to come over the whole loop and then reach the destination so there is one ring for that what is the other ring for ? we put two rings or sometimes may be even three or four  two is quite common   one important reason for putting two rings is that if there is a failure in the network there is a possibility of the communication still going on look at the picture b let us say one particular node has come down that means  there is some problem in this thing if these nodes can sense that this has really gone down  they will sort of wrap the ring around now physically this still looks like a broken ring but if you look at it as a single ring  this is still a ring going through the nodes these nodes can still communicate although there is a breakage over here either this node may break or this link may fail so many things may happen so this fault tolerance is one good reason for using rings especially in the wide area network  we have a lot of things for example  let us say  these telephone exchanges are connected in some fashion using fiber optics cable we will be talking about all those things later on but they usually put them on a ring because if the cable is cut at some place they can still communicate by using the trick that i have just shown  refer slide time  25  46  28  24  this is the summary of the characteristics of the ring topology there is no beginning or end it is actually a ring all devices have equal access to media one good thing about it is that all of them should get data at some particular point of time so they have equal access to this media in a single ring  data travels in one direction only a double ring allows fault tolerance each device has to wait its turn to transmit that means you can not start transmitting as soon as you want to transmit you have to take your turn ; and most common type is the token ring token ring has got its ieee standard number  ieee 802.5   in a token ring what happens is that the token contains the data it reaches the destination data is extracted  acknowledgement of receipt sent back to transmitting device  removed  empty token passed for another device to use that is one way a ring can be used for example  you make a data packet with this token as well as whatever you want to send to the final user so this whole packet will go over to the next node in the ring this way  it keeps hopping from one node to another till the destination when the destination gets this packet  it knows that the destination had this or some kind of identification which will be there somehow in this whole bunch of data the destination node will know that this is meant for it it will extract the data it may be put in an acknowledgement if you are using the protocol which uses acknowledgement and send it along the ring it will go around the ring and come back to the original sender and the sender will know that this data has been received that will remove this acknowledgement also and the empty token is passed and this token keeps on circulating in the ring whoever wants to transmit has to wait till it gets the token .as soon as it gets the empty token it will put in the data that it wants to send and send it along in the same way  refer slide time  28  25  30  07  ring topology has its advantages and disadvantages the advantages are that  data packets travel at great speed now one reason why data packets can travel at great speed is that this is a very synchronous operation if you remember that in a shared medium where the nodes are not synchronizing their actions  what might happen is that two different nodes may start transmitting at the same time and then their data will collide in the broadcast medium  hence killing both the communications here such a thing can not happen because it has all been synchronized with the help of the token there are others ways of synchronization we will come to all that later on data packets can travel at great speeds there are no collisions it is easier to find faults and rectify faults and terminators are not required as in an ordinary cable the disadvantages are  it requires more cable than a bus and a couple of breakdowns may bring the entire ring down smaller rings exist nowadays but anyway they are not very common this is not as common as the bus so far as the local area network is concerned in a wide area network a ring is very common as a matter of fact the ring is the most common topology that wide area network could use  refer slide time  30  08  31  00  many lan technologies that use ring topology use token passing for synchronized access to the ring the ring itself is treated as a single shared communication medium bits pass from transmitter past other computers  and are copied by destination hardware should be designed to pass token even if attached computer is out of commission this is a small technicality if the interface of the computer to the ring can function independently of the computer  that will be nice  because even if the computer is shut down  other people ? s communications are not affected  refer slide time  31  01  31  38  this is a picture of the token ring  in which the sender holding token transmits bits of frames computer not holding the token passes the bits as they go around  circulate at a very high speed the destination passes the bits but it makes a copy and the sender receives the bits of a frame and it goes out this is one way the network could work  refer slide time  31  39  31  53  when a computer wants to transmit  it waits for the token after transmission computer transmits token on the ring to the next computer ready to transmit it receives token and then transmits this token ring was originally part of a lan technology  refer slide time  31  54  34  22  but then it fell into disuse first of all the token ring devices were less common they were more costly hence the token ring as a dominant lan technology went out with time but one version of it called fddi lived on and that lived on due to the very specific advantage that the ring topology has which is fault tolerance this technology is called fddi in a fddi  the ring is made of fiber optic cables multi mode fibers or even single mode fibers can be used they use fiber optic cables in which we can send data at a fairly high speed but the speed available is not comparable to the level possible nowadays fddi technology is also not that new it is aging and that way its speed may sound less today but when it was proposed it was taken as a very high speed the basic reason why somebody still would like to use fddi is its inherent fault tolerance capability that is the technology  which is used in lan  and it is fault tolerant ring technology  which is fault tolerant  is extensively used some other technology is extensively used in wan but in the lan we have this fddi technology whose full form is fiber distributed data interconnect this is another about ring technology which uses fiber optic between stations  which transmits data at 100 mbps when we were talking about the thin lan and the thick lan we were talking about 10 mbps speed ? 100 mbps was an order of magnitude high when it was proposed it uses pairs of fibers to form two concentric rings in order to get the fault tolerance we require with two fibers or two rings  refer slide time  34  23  35  48  as soon as a fault occurs somewhere  the fddi will automatically switch off and communication will not get disturbed furthermore you can have hybrid topology in the sense that you can have a ring  which emanates from the various nodes of the rings stars will form ; they will be the different hubs of the different stars and these different hubs can be put in a ring as a matter of fact  this is the very common way how fddi is configured some fddi switches form a ring and from each of these fddi switches  we can start other kind of technologies like ethernet etc  which form a tree-like structure the other reason why you could have hybrid topology is that older networks are updated and replaced  leaving some older segments you have replaced one part of network ; you will get a hybrid kind of topology thus it combines two or different more different types of topologies the common one is star bus or star ring star ring uses an mau  multi-station access unit   which is basically a part of fddi  refer slide time  35  54  38  48  next we take up the study of mesh topology by a mesh or a full mesh  it is meant a complete graph as shown here as discussed earlier  a complete mesh would take a lot of cable but at the same time with complete mesh we have lot of alternative paths from any node to any other node the diagram shows eight nodes and each one of them is connected to every other node now between any two nodes  you will have direct path and indirect paths as well we have many paths for going from the same source to the same destination this means that when one of the links breaks  all of them can still communicate without any problem as this arrangement takes lot of cables  we do not use this what we use is a partial mesh in a partial mesh some of these links would be dropped  taking care that none of the nodes becomes disconnected but all the links of the mesh need not be there even in the partial mesh we can still have some form of redundancy and thus have some level of fault tolerance but it may be not as much as one available in a full mesh for such a partial mesh the network topology is not well specified and it is difficult to evolve a protocol like token passing protocol so here you have to have some other method of sensing the faults and correcting them that becomes more complicated but the partial mesh topology is used in many places  refer slide time  38  49  39  55  mesh topology of course is not common on lans these are most often used in wans to interconnect lans because wan links usually are costly the users of a wan link naturally expect a certain grade of service that is why the wan service providers usually keep alternative paths if one of the paths becomes unavailable due to some node failure or due to some link failure then it can still send the traffic across the wan through some alternative paths  refer slide time  39  56  40  35  so the pros and cons of mesh topology are like this the advantage is of course it improves fault tolerance and it can carry more data the disadvantages of course are increased cost installation  difficulty in management and troubleshooting  slide reference time  40  41  41  20  now we have seen that each of these topologies has advantages as well as disadvantages rings ease synchronization  but it may be disabled if a cable breaks star is easier to manage and more robust but it requires more cable bus requires fewer cables  may be disabled if cable breaks and is not so reliable bus would not have fault tolerance really so as far as the lan is concerned  people are gravitating towards star topology that means some nodes or some computers may be connected to a switch and then some other computers may be connected to some other switch and then these switches will get connected in some fashion extended star topology is the most common topology as this is emerging in local area networks in wide area networks we have both ring as well as mesh topologies  refer slide time  41  21-46  12  the physical and the logical topologies may be different something will look like a physical star but it may actually be a ring let us look at the following examples suppose you have this as the hub of the star and we have these three stations a  b  and c ; we have say cable ducts running over there like this  through which a number of cables are passing at the central hub you might connect two cables like this and then more pairs of cables in a similar manner because this is one central place you can do this what you essentially have is a ring what you essentially have is a ring similarly  you can have any other kind of topology suppose you have a number of cables coming in like this now if we have a connection like this and similarly in all other places  then you can actually have a mesh although all this is within one physical duct and another physical duct going to nodes a  b  c  and d  it looks very much like a physical star but the actual connection is something like a mesh just as i could make a star  i could make it a mesh also the media is the physical topology whereas the way in which data access the medium and transmits packets is the logical topology a lan at a network is not always revealing cables emerging from a hub do not make it necessarily a star topology it may actually be a bus or a ring in a star topology  there is some piece of network box  which is called a hub this hub actually replaces the single cable this is again a shared medium if they are connected like a star it has got the star connection people use hubs these days but they do not use the single cable like thin lan and thick lan though it looks like a star  depending upon what kind of box it is  it could be actually a bus similarly as i have shown you  it could be a ring also  refer slide time  46  14  47  27  now the choice of logical topology is going to affect the physical topology and of course the other way around the kind of physical topology you will have will also dictate the kind of logical topology that you can have the kind of logical topology you can have will depend on two things ? one the actual physical topology  the number of cables you have etc  another is the type of network boxes like switches  hubs or whatever you have as the nodes we have to design carefully because it may be difficult to change the part way through the installation when you think about designing a network  you have to put the physical topology min place to get the correct logical topology your choice will determine cable installation network  network connections and protocols and spots where you will drill holes in the building  refer slide time  47  33  50  48  the different factors which you take into account while deciding on a particular topology are  the first thing that comes is what kind of technology you are going to use ? there are different kinds of lan technologies ? for example  if you are using fddi  then you have to have a logical ring somewhere if you are using the ethernet  you may have an extended star topology the kind of technology you are using is a factor and of course this technology will have some cost benefit as a matter of fact  in a lan  you will find that apart from the network boxes  in greenfield kind of situation   the cost of the cable is also significant then there is a question of scalability often what people will do is that  they will work with one kind of network and then  very soon  the network will get choked or people will want more bandwidth or more users will join this keeps on happening a network is never a stable thing in any organization ; but whenever you are putting some kind of topology or some kind of technology you have to think that 3 years to 5 years down the line  you will have to scale the network up you may have to change the number of your network boxes ; some of the boxes for example in old technology you may have had a bus by putting in a hub it was a physical star  but it is a bus now you put a switch over there and make it a star topology kind of thing and then later on people want more bandwidth when more people want to join  you have to design your physical topology that way for scalability  the bandwidth capacity and the ease of installation because how you take the cables around and how you scale up down and how you can install it are always problems ease of finding fault is another important factor we will talk more about it in the next class it is good to have a central cabling plan where all cables are coming you can manage all your cables in one central place .there are standards like structured cabling which are used for easy fault finding and maintenance thank you ! preview of next lecture good day ! today we will be talking about multiplexing  refer slide time  51  15  51  18   refer slide time  51  25  51  32  multiplexing is about sharing a medium different users share the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  51  40  52  00  a medium can normally carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signals will get garbled .for multiple signals to share one medium  the medium must somehow be divided to give each signal a portion of total bandwidth a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource as far as communication is concerned we try to use this bandwidth somehow to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers.that is the idea of multiplexing there are various reasons why we want to use multiplexing and the chief one is that of transmission services which are  refer slide time  52  43  53  35  very expensive  in leased lines packet switched networks  for example  laying of line in itself fairly expensive and complex proposition and once you lay a line you really like to utilize it to the maximum the other thing is that  if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication multiplexing and compression techniques save a lot of money for the business when you can send a lot of data through the same line the data capacity of the line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company .most data devices individually require modest amount of data but with a number of users their aggregated requirements may occupy quite a substantial bandwidth  refer slide time  53  52  54  03  the current technique to accomplish this include frequency division multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing  refer slide time  54  04  54  49  in the scheme of multiplexing  you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side .so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link .on the other side  depending on how you have put them together  they are separated into different lines these different lines can now go to different recipients on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here a number of sender receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in between  refer slide time  54  50  55  32  the alternative to multiplexing should be direct point to point connection this has number of problems .first problem is that you need those lines that we need for each device you thus need a large amount of wiring if they are on different floors  you need large number of io ports on the computer side  which really is not feasible you may have a few io ports  but you can not have hundreds of io ports it is really difficult to have hundreds of io ports .that is also another bottleneck   refer slide time  55  33  55  54  in a somewhat older approach  multi drop line   the host polls machine to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines total communications load is not greater than the rate of line  refer slide time  55  55  56  15  using a multiplexer approach all the device data ? s are multiplexed on one side  sent through one a line out link carries multiple channels of information  refer slide time  56  16  56  20  the signal will be restored depending on the quantum of noise present .if the noise is high then we will lose some information there will be some distortion and some loss of information would be there in case of digital signals it is more fault tolerant and more resilient compared to analog signals  refer slide time  57  01  57  17  we can correct errors in transmission using digital signals we add few bytes of error checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected i will give you a simple example  suppose we are sending groups of eight bits called byte now what can we do is that associated with each byte we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make the number of ones in whole nine bits to be odd  this is an example of odd parity now if at the receiver end we find that the number of ones have become even we know that  some bits must have flipped that means some bits must instead of zero have got a one and instead of one we got a zero it must have happened otherwise because the number of bits are supposed to be odd and of course by adding one bit we can always dictate that the number of bits in the original that means the sending station was odd .in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit the whole bunch once again hopefully there will not be error next time this is of course a very primitive kind of error checking there are more sophisticated error checking methods employed in networks and communications  refer slide time  58  40  58  48  computer networks prof .sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology i.i.t kharagpur lecture no # 3 physical medium  i good day in this third lecture we will be looking at physical medium in the last lecture we have seen two protocol stacks  we have seen osi protocol stack in detail and we had a look at its cpi pre reference stack but whatever be the model  at the bottom-most layer you have the physical medium because  after all  if two computers have to communicate  there has to be some physical medium between them so we will just look at some general characteristics of physical medium and how data can travel along them  today in the next lecture we are going to look at some specific media which are used in networks  refer slide time  01  36  2  26  as we talk about the physical medium  we have to talk about two different modes of communication  so to say one is analog and the other is digital  so you have before you that top one is the analog signal ; you can see that it can take any shape  and the digital signal is some kind of signal  which represents a series of ones and zeros ? stream of bits  but analog signals of course can take any value in them  refer slide time  2  27  3  20  and one important consideration for any medium is its bandwidth bandwidth is the capacity of a media to carry information now  the total capacity may be divided into channels ? i mean there is one total capacity you can sort of divide it into channels ? and give different channels to different users ; specific portion of the channel may not be used for direct communication but for control purpose and other specific purpose but whatever it is  any particular medium and technology will have a certain capacity and this is really important because  after all  your speed of communication will depend on the capacity of the medium  refer slide time  3  21  5  19  this inherent capacity of the medium is of course intermittently linked with the kind of signal one particular channel can carry for example  on the left-hand side  you see some digital signal and just on its right you have something that looks like a bargraph ? actually this is a representation of the same signal in a different way  what this right-hand side says is basically if you have a series of a sin x + b sin 2x + c sin 3x + d sin 4x and so on where a  b  c  d represent the values shown by the graph on the right-hand side  if you sum all that sin values up  you will get the signal on the left-hand side so the channel  if it has to carry the digital signal  has to be able to carry all these harmonics ? harmonics means the sin x constant  sin 2x constant  sin 3 etc so all these harmonics it should be able to carry ; whereas if you look at the second figure b  it is a pure sin wave so this just has one harmonic  a sin x or something like that this third figure has two harmonics  say a sin x + b sin 2 x ; so depending on the complexity of the wave form that you want to carry  you want more and more bandwidth for the channel  refer slide time  5  20  6  24  now for this we make a comparison of analog verses digital signals digital signals have some basic advantages the most basic advantages is that it is that less error prone that means if there is some kind of distortion in the signal between the source and destination that can be rectified very easily and to limited extent errors can be corrected whereas if you are talking about analog signal there is little control over signal distortion of course this also old technology and this has got some limitations in technology in the sense that how many people can use  etc there are some limitations over here so digital signals are of course in general preferred  although analog signal still rules in some niche areas  refer slide time  6  25  07  30  so let us see what we mean by the statement that digital signals are less error-prone in this figure we see in the left-hand side have some analog signal and then some noise has come ; that means  some distortion has come and the signal looks like the one below when noise affects an analog signal  it is hard to deduce the original signal from this whereas the same kind of noise or a similar kind of noise if it is gets superimposed on the digital signal as we see on the right  the signal gets distorted  but since we know that the original signal was sort of square shaped  we can deduce the original signal from the distorted signal so  despite the noise  noise can be eliminated easily in digital communication that is the greatest advantage of the digital communication  refer slide time  07  31 -8  51  and so far as the bandwidth of a channel is concerned  suppose we know the bandwidth  h  of the channel and the number of signal levels  v  being used  what is the maximum number of bits that we could transmit ? suppose we are trying to transmit bits in terms of digital signal ; so there is a nyquist limit it says that maximum bits per second = 2 * h * log2 v for example if the bandwidth is 3100 hz and we are using 16 level modulation then the maximum number of bits per second is log2  16  is four so 4 ? 2 ? 3100  that is 24800 bps 24.8 kbps so this is the maximum number of bits that we can send through the channel of this particular bandwidth so the higher the bandwidth of the channel  the higher the number of bits that we can send through it  but depending on the bandwidth  there is always a hard limit on how fast we can communicate  refer slide time  8  52-10  42  let us look at this regeneration of the digital signals once more we say that it is reliable because it can regenerate slightly damaged signals since there are only two states  for example  this is the original signal  which is a square  and it is grossly distorted as it is received this becomes weaker in strength and the shape has also been deformed but we can regenerate it since we know that the original shape of the signal must have been a square one so we regenerate it as a square one if there are two states of a voltage  let us say  + 10 volts ? 10 volts and the signal is + 8 volts  let us say  then it is quite possible that this that this + 8 volts is a result of noise  which is superimposed on + 10 volts rather than a result of noise superimposed on ? 10 volts so whenever you get + 8 volts  simply make it 10 volts with some electronics and the original signal will be restored of course i mean if the noise is very high  there is a limit to how much you can restore if the noise is very high then it will not be possible then we will know because ? 10 volts also becomes 8 volts in the case of a spike  and then whatever restoration we do will be a wrong one so we lose some information ; there will be some distortion and some loss of information will be there so there is always a limit but in the case of digital signals it is more fault-tolerant or resistant to noise  more resilient compared to analog signals  refer slide time  10  42  12  34  so we can correct errors in transmission ? that is another advantage of digital signals so what we do is that we add a few bytes of error-checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected i will give you a simple example  suppose we are sending groups of 8 bits called bytes ; now what we can do is that associated with each byte  we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make let us say the number of 1s in the whole 9 bits to be odd  this is an example of an odd parity now  if at the receiver ? s end  we find that the number of 1s have become even  we know that some bit must have flipped that means  some bit must have flipped ; instead of a 0  we got 1 and instead of a 1  we got a 0 it must have happened otherwise  because the number of bits was supposed to be odd ? and of course by adding 1  we can always dictate the number of bits in the original that the sending station was odd ? in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit that whole bunch once again ; hopefully there will not be an error next time this is of course a very primitive kind of error-checking ; there are more sophisticated error-checking methods employed in networks and communication so this error-checking and correction of error at the receiver ? s end is possible if you have adopted a very sophisticated coding technique so that is possible in case of digital transmission ; this is not possible in analog transmission  refer slide time  12  36-14  04  another advantage is that a digital signal can be encrypted  which makes it possible to carry sensitive information on the network for example  e-banking is coming in vogue ? that means  somebody does a bank transaction on the network similarly e-commerce ? that means you want to buy something online and then pay through your credit card  etc online now how does the transaction take place ? the point is that you are sending some information  may be your credit card number  may be some password  etc somebody can snoop on you in-between  so they will know your secrets and use the same set of numbers to may be buy something else  and the money will go from your bank account ; that is obviously not acceptable in this case when we send it down the network  we encrypt it in a way that even if somebody snoops and finds out the stream of bits that is going  he will not be able to make out the original numbers from this current stream so this is encryption and this is a very important application these days  refer slide time  14  05  15  54  so encryption is another advantage of digital transmission compression is another ; that means  we can compress a message before transmission and decompress it at the other end so the overall load on the circuit and the network is lighter ; since the load is lighter it is less expensive sometimes when you compress information there may be some loss of information ; there are lossy compression techniques and they are non-lossy compression techniques lossy compression technique is where you may lose some information  but it may not matter for example  let us say you want to send a digital photograph a digital photograph may have a very high resolution ; if you compress it and decompress on the other end  you may lose a few bits but the image that you get on the other end would still look almost as good as the original one of course  trained persons can look at it and find out there is something missing but it will almost serve the purpose sometimes loss compression is acceptable and of course there is loss-less compression also when you compress it and send it  it is a less expensive way of sending i mean you are sending the same information but only your are taking less amount of space ; of course you have to do the compression and decompression at the two ends  so that is some kind of overhead on the two sides  refer slide time  15  55  17  07  suppose we have some data ; how do we encode this digitally ? well  the simplest way  of course  is by the presence or absence of a signal let us say a positive voltage might represent a binary zero or a binary one or vice versa maybe if you have high voltage  you say that is i will interpret that is as one being sent and if i have a low voltage i interpret this as a zero being sent of course  when i am saying voltage  i am assuming that we are having some kind of electrical signal traveling ; that is not always the case for example  if you are using light for communication the presence of light may indicate one and the absence of light may indicate zero so whatever we code it  whatever be the medium  this is the simplest wave to encode data into a digital form the current state indicates the value of the data  refer slide time  17  08  18  31  if your signal is digital  sometimes you are forced to send some digital signal by analog transmission  but this is usually not preferred analog signal will transmit whatever signal comes regardless of whether it represents digital or analog data so it uses amplifiers other than the kind of regeneration that is possible in digital voice  the trouble with amplifiers is that it also boosts noise  whereas in the digital case we could take out the noise and regenerate the original shape of the signal here we can amplify it  so that if a signal becomes weak we can make it stronger ; but whatever noise is coming with the signal that also gets amplified this is okay for voice  but for digital data using analog transmission usually is not done because we have so little control over the correctness of whatever we are sending  refer slide time  18  32-19  58  digital transmission is concerned with the content of the signal ; it uses repeaters which recover the pattern of zeros and ones and then retransmits this can be used with analog signal if it carries digital data you know sometimes analog signal carries digital data ; it recovers the digital data from the analog signal  generates new clean analog signal this is becoming more standard ; for example  when you are connecting to the network  to the internet  from your home computer you may have use the modem and the telephone connection now what is happening over here is that the telephone line is essentially an analog medium ; so an analog signal will go over there on that  but whatever is coming out of your computer is digital so what you do is that you make this digital data ride on some analog signals to this modem pairs so that it reaches the telephone exchange at the telephone exchange it is converted back to digital data and the backbone and the core of the telephony system is purely digital  refer slide time  19  59  22  26  so there are various ways in which you can encode digital information in the analog domain one is the amplitude shift keying  which means the two binary numbers 0 and 1 are represented by two different amplitudes of carrier waves this is not very efficient ; uses up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines ; and is used to transmit digital data over optical fiber in the amplitude shift keying  although the signal is analog we know that there are only two levels  which this signal is supposed to take  i.e  two amplitudes  low amplitude and high amplitude it may be 0 and some amplitude if a 1 is to be transmitted may be we give this high amplitude and if a 0 is to be transmitted  we may use a low amplitude analog signal you may say this is the kind of thing which is done in the optical domain ; but in the electrical domain this is not very efficient more common is the so-called frequency shift keying in frequency shift keying  we use the two binaries ; that means we use two different frequencies for the two binary digits  0 and 1 so this is less susceptible to error than amplitude shift keying  and again  it sends up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines and is commonly used for high-frequency radio another way of encoding is the so-called phase shift keying two binary numbers may be represented by phase shift of carrier wave ; so this is more efficient and noise resistant than fsk ; this is psk it can be raised up to 9.6 kbps  kilo bits per second  on a voice grade line this is for a simple phase shift keying ; of course  we use more complex phase shift keying with other techniques in order to achieve even higher data rates nowadays  refer slide time  22  27  24  01  these techniques can be combined so it is common to combine phase shift and amplitude shift keying so we can get about 56 kbps on a voice grade line the modems that we buy usually are all 56 kbps  connected with some technique called multilevel signaling each signal represents more then one bit so this is also possible one is the signal  which indicates the level of the voltage or whatever it is  the phase or frequency  the level of the signal ; the other is the bit or bits that it may represent so  for example  if you have a simple technique  it will represent a 0 or a 1 by the current level of the signal  which is the simplest kind of technique  these two are the same one is the bit rate  that is  the number of bits of information that you are sending ; the other is the baud rate  that is  the number of times the signal will change per second ? the maximum number of times the signal will change per second so in the simplest case  baud rate and bit rate may be the same but that is not always the case  refer slide time  24  02  29  29  so we look at the other side of the coin  which is the digital encoding of analog information and a very common case is the telephones for example  as i just now told you  the heart of the telephone exchanges and the telephone switches and the trunk exchanges and the core network of the telephone system are nowadays entirely digital whereas our voice  of course  is analog by the way  the real world  in which we move around  is mostly analog now this digital is something that we adopt in-between in order to get these advantages of robustness  resiliency  error correction  etc our voice is analog  but the core telephone system is digital so at some point  our voice  an analog signal  has to be converted into a digital signal of course  our handsets also are mostly analog so they are going to be carried may be in this analog fashion right up to the nearest exchange ; but there  there will be a set of codecs  coders and decoders  which will convert this analog voice signal to a digital signal now  what kind of digital signal will a voice give ? the calculation is something like this  the voice data in a telephone system is limited to a maximum of 4 khz this telephone is a very good quality  the first so-called gold quality but this is not high fidelity kind of sound it is less than high fidelity  but very very clear  for all practical purposes for the telephone at least if i limit the bandwidth to 4 khz  we get some distortion  but nothing very noticeable so voice is still very clear we have to send this 4 khz of analog signal  whatever information is there  within 4 khz bandwidth we have to send this analog signal to the other side in a digital form ; that is  we have to digitize it there is a nyquist rate  which is like the nyquist limit that we have seen some time back nyquist rate  which says that if we sample any analog signal at double the maximum frequency that the particular analog signal has  then essentially we will have all the information that is needed to fully reconstruct the original analog signal from this sample so if you have 4 khz of signal  4 khz of bandwidth  we require 8000 samples per second let us say you have this analog voice ; so per second we will take 8000 samples  sample values at different points so  of course  at some points my voice may be low so i may have a small amplitude ; at some point my voice may be very high so i can have a large amplitude now that we break up each of these into a code of 8 bits  the point is that with the 8 bits  you can really distinguish between 256 levels and our assumption is that from the 0 level to the highest level that is admissible  we take it ; whatever it is  if you break it up in to 256 parts  that is good enough for capturing how high or low the volume is so a level of 256 is really quite a lot we require 8 bits for each of the sample and we require 8000 samples that makes it 8 ? 8  that is  64 kilo bits per second  64 kbps please remember this rate ? 64 kilo bits per second ? it is the fundamental unit on which a whole lot of all other technology  etc has been built and basically  it has come especially from telephony  because the telephone people had the first network and 64 kbps happened to be the rate which was set for a voice so naturally  of course  if you want to carry 1 voice channel  we will have a 64 kbps if you want to carry 1000 voice channels  you will require 64 kbps ? 1000  that is  64 mbps capacity so they planned their network depending on how many voice channels they want to carry where ; but 64 kbps is the basic unit in most places in telecommunications  refer slide time  29  31  32  53  now let us take a quick look at how data is encoded the simplest one is of course using the level of the voltage ; for example  over here this is the non return to zero level  the so-called nrz encoding it uses two different voltage levels to represent 0s and 1s ; typically negative voltage equals 1 and positive voltage equals 0 and the signal never returns to 0 voltage so it flip flops between a negative voltage and a positive voltage the value during bit time is a level voltage ; that means  during the duration of a bit 0 or 1 the voltage really remains the same so there is a transition at the boundaries of bit and of course  if there are two 1s then there will be no transition as we can see ; if there are two 0s consecutively  then there will be no transition so the number of transition is much less and it is a very simple kind of scheme this has some problem we will come to that later on ; but let us look at another variant of this non return to zero  which is nrzi that means non return to zero and invert on 1s that means once again we keep constant voltage during bit time ? no transition represents 0 and transition from low to high or from high to low is a 1 so the same bit pattern  0 0 1 1 0 1 is represented by a different voltage pattern over here there is no transition 0 0 and then there is a 1  so there is a transition ; there is another 1  there is a transition ; 0 no transition ; then again the 1  then another transition so this is another way of encoding now the trouble with these encodings is that suppose you have a large number of 0s  a large train of 0s  there is no transition really by the way  there is one point ? the reason they use the positive voltage and negative voltage rather than a positive voltage and zero voltage or zero voltage and negative voltage is that you want to distinguish between a 0 being sent and no signal being sent so that is one point and the other point is that as i was saying if there is a constant train of 0s in the original data then we will have a constant level signal in the system now if that be so  the synchronization of the clocks between the sender and the receiver tends to drift off and then the receiver  i mean in the worst case  the signal may go one off or it may interpret the signal in a very wrong fashion so this is the problem of this nrz and nrzi  which is taken care of  refer slide time  32  54  33  46  by some other kind of encoding ; we will come to that later on so this is a just a quick look at the disadvantages of nrz code ? hard to tell where one bit ends or starts ; with long string of 0s or 1s  any drift between timing of transmitter and receiver results in errors so there is a bit phase encoding  which uses the least transition per bit time so if you use at least one transition per bit time  what would happen is that the sender and the receiver clocks can remain in very close synchronization with each other ? that is a nice property ? and there is predictable bit transition during each bit time so an absence of a transition indicates an error so two examples are manchester and differential manchesters  refer slide time  33  47-34  29  so this is manchester encoding you see that at the middle of each bit 0 or 1  there is a transition now  low to high transition means 1 and high to low transition means 0 so the same pattern ? 0 0 1 1 0 1 ? is there for each bit ; you will see there is a transition in-between  and low to high transition is 1 and high to low transition is a 0 so this is the encoding  which is used in ethernets and many lans  refer slide time  30 35  42  there is another variant of this called differential manchester ; in this  the midbit transmission is really for clock synchronization purposes they do not represent either 0 or 1 so what it does is that transition at the beginning of a bit period is equal to 0 and the absence of a transition is bit period 1 so 0 0 ? when this 0 starts  there is a transition transition at the beginning of the bit period is a 0 ; but when the 1 starts  there is no transition there is a transition in the middle anyway ; that is for clocking purpose then at the next level  once again if there is no transition if there is a second one coming  there is no transition and so on this was used in token ring networks ; of course token ring networks are becoming less popular these days but anyway  this is another one there are other kinds of encoding techniques  but these are the common ones so you see that there are different ways of encoding the digital data into these different signal levels  refer slide time  35  43  38  29  signal levels and bit rates are different the rate at which the signals change is the baud rate  and the rate at which bits are sent is the bit rate the other thing we can consider is the analog encoding of analog information of course  this does not come too much in computer networks  but this is an important area in communications in general so of course  if you have an analog signal  it can directly be sent sometimes it is sent in the raw form ; sometimes that is not very practical  so we have to convert this to an analog signal maybe at higher frequency  and the most common example of this is the radio for example  a radio is carrying voice or may be some sound  etc the voice  as you know  is only 4 khz  but if you take a 4 khz signal and try to send it over the atmosphere  it will not reach any where  excepting in its close vicinity so  in order to reach out to all these different locations  you have to send your radio signal at a very high frequency ; but the information that is it carrying is still at that 4 khz bandwidth so this 4 khz bandwidth is sort of translated ; so there is a very high-frequency so-called carrier wave  which is carrying this 4 khz of signal if it is only voice of course if it is music  etc  you may like to have a somewhat higher bandwidth also ; but anyway  that is also analog signal and this is also analog signal so one analog signal is carrying the other analog signal and there are various ways of doing this so-called modulation the three most common ones are amplitude modulation  frequency modulation  and phase modulation so we will not talk much about this because in amplitude modulation as you can understand  the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal ; similarly  in frequency modulation the frequency of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal ; and then in pm the phase is changed according to the signal  refer slide time  38  30 -39  58  so this is another picture of digital signaling so called current state ; that means zero represents the low voltage one is represented by the high voltage and digital signaling and state transition ; so if there is no transition that is zero if there is a transition that is the one so these are all different examples of encoding  refer slide time  38  59  39  35  as i was telling  the bit rate and the baud rate are different the maximum number of times a signal can change in a second is called the baud rate and the number of bits  1s and 0s transmitted in a second is called the bit rate in the examples we have seen so far  the bit rate and baud rate are the same ; this is not always the case the bit rate can be higher than the baud rate if we use more then two signal levels ; and the other one is also possible  the bit rate may be lower than the baud rate  refer slide time  39  36  41  15  now let us look at some of the inherent trouble with all these physical media that means  when we are throwing some signal  when we are trying to send some signal down some transmission medium ? it may be a piece of wire it may be this whole atmosphere or it may be a fiber optic cable ? there will be some kind of distortion  some kind of change in the original signal  that will inevitably come into play so we will look at some of these ; we have to really take care of all these these signals and these kinds of effects can not be eliminated i mean the world is not perfect and they are basic properties of the medium so we will have to design our systems in such a way that in spite of all these efforts the whole communication will still go on very correctly as a signal propagates  the signal changes as it travels ; so the receiver may not be able to recognize it as such for example  this shows an example of an original signal and the final signal this kind of change and distortion etc may be attributed to the following effects   refer slide time  41  16  42  51  the first one  the very first one  is attenuation a signal get weaker as it propagates ; attenuation becomes greater with distance naturally  and of course  finally  the signal will become too weak to recognize so the original signal strength is something but as the distance grows signals become weaker and weaker for example  let us say this kind of weakening is dependent on the property of the medium ; it also depends on the kind of frequency you are using for sending for example  let us say an am signal will not be received at a very large distance  whereas a short wave signal may travel some other way and come over here similarly  if you take a local area network or a cable  then if you make the cable very long ? there are other technical problems for making cable very long ? but even from the signal propagation point of view  the signal will get weaker and weaker because there will be leakage currents in the cable  current will leak out  etc finally  the signal that we will get will be very weak so this is a very fundamental property of any medium similarly  if you take an optical medium and if you send a light pulse through it  as it travels  the light pulse will get weaker ? that is one of the effects there are other effects  but this is one of the major effects  refer slide time  42  51  44  27  apart from attenuation  there is distortion that means  the signal changes shapes as it propagates now if it changes shapes in this way  the adjacent bits may overlap  may make recognition impossible for the receiver  so what might happen if the signal changes shape ? why does it change the shape ? if you remember in the very beginning i had shown you one slide of a square wave kind and we talked about some harmonics so the square wave may be looked upon as a sum of all these harmonics  a sum of all these sign waves now all the harmonics or sign waves are of different frequencies ? we had talked about the sin x sin 2 x and sin 3 x and so on ? so they are of different frequencies now signals of different frequencies change or get affected by the medium differently so a signal of a particular frequency may be attenuated less ; the signal at a much higher frequency may be attenuated much more or vice versa the point is that signals at different frequencies will get affected by the medium in different ways so finally  the relative strengths of the different frequencies will be different when you go to the far end ; that means  when you go to the receiving end  when you add that all up  you will get a different shape you will not get the old square shape or whatever shape you have sent ; you will not get that back so this is called distortion  refer slide time  44  27  45  31  then  of course  it is going to pick up noise there is thermal energy in wire  which is everywhere so this energy is some kind of inherent noise that will always come ; then there will be random signals so spikes may sometimes occur ; say  some car is starting somewhere so there will be some static discharge ; the lightning strikes somewhere  there is somebody running a motor  somebody is running a washing machine  all these things add to the general noise in our atmosphere and this medium  which is carrying a signal  will also catch some of this noise sometimes of course  the noise is so sharp that it may change the transmission in such a manner that you will not get the original signal back so sometimes such a thing may happen  refer slide time  45  31  46  47  what we want is a high signal-to-noise ratio in order to distinguish between the signal and the noise if the noise is very low and the signal is high  we can still distinguish at the receiving end between what is a signal and what is a noise and take the signal out  take out the noise but for this we want a high signal-to-noise ratio signal strength divided by the average noise strength is the snr and as snr falls  error will increase so in this figure  you can see that as the signal becomes weaker and weaker and touches the noise floor may be goes below it when it goes below it  the noise becomes more than the signal ; then no meaningful communication can be carried out so in general  we want a strong signal-to-noise ratio so one thing we might do quite often is that suppose we do have to send a signal to a very long distance  the signal will naturally get weak so in-between  we will put some amplifiers or repeaters or regenerators  which will take the signal  try to filter out the noises as much as possible  then amplify the signal and make it stronger  and then push it for the next span so after some distance  again another repeater will take it up and regenerate the signals we have to go on doing that so that i maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio even at the receiving end  refer slide time  47  26  47  38  then of course  as i said that  there is interference that means energy from outside the wire adds to signal  like noise  which is often intermittent  and is very hard to control or diagnose  refer slide time  47  38  48  49  one important point is that a very strong interference can occur at cable termination so there are two things  first of all  if two cables are running in parallel  what might happen is the signal in one may affect the signal in the other so there is some kind of linkage between the two the so-called cross talk ? that is one thing this is more pronounced at the termination end ; at the termination end  if you do not terminate the thing properly  if you just leave it like this  the kind of distortion and the kind of noise that will be introduced will be much more so whenever we are putting some wired kind of network infrastructure  we have to be very careful about the termination  because that is where a lot of noise can come in so often there will be multiple wires in a bundle ; each radiates some of its signal  causes interference in nearby wires and this is especially bad at terminations where wires are unwound and are parallel  refer slide time  48  49  49  36  finally i just mentioned this  that when carrying digital data over analog lines  we require modems modem stands for modulation and demodulation this is used to connect a digital computer to an analog phone system usually  but modems can also be used elsewhere it can be installed internally or a card inserted into the motherboard or can be connected to the serial port  etc so now we understand why modems are required because essentially  digital data will have to be carried on the analog system the field of communication  as you know  is a very interesting field and we could not go too much into the details of communications but we have just talked about the very basics of communications used in computer networks  because remember computer network or some computers or some network nodes are connected via some communication lines so communication is absolutely important ; it is all-important in this ; so we have talked about this.in the next lecture  we will look at some of the medium that is actually used or deployed in common networks thank you preview of next lecture lecture no # 4 physical medium  ii today we will  have the second lecture on the physical media in the last lecture we have seen the different ways the digital signals and analog signals  etc how they can be used for communication how digital data or analog data can be encoded and some of the general impairments of physical medium in this lecture we are going to look at specific media which are used in networking  refer slide time  51  18  51  20   refer slide time  51  21 ? 52  30  so there are basically two types of mediawhich are used for communication one is cable i mean they are two different classes are together so one is a cable now this cable could be some copper cable they could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair so the twisted pair i mean we sometimes there actually unshielded twisted pair or utp sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common there are shielded twisted pairs also and then of course the one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic these are the different types of cables that we use in networks similarly we can also communicate without the use of any cables by simple electromagnetic radiation and these radiation could be in different ranges of the frequencies like they could be infrared or microwave or radio or satellite etc so we will look at all these one by one  refer slide time  52  31  55  25  first let us look at the kind of media that we use in a lan lan as you remember is a local area network and a local area network could vary from let us say one meter to one kilometer so its is local strictly by some means of size in some way so one meter means two computer connected siding on the same table connected side by side it could be all the computer in one building and all the computers in several buildings and so on so that is the kind of range that we have for lan  and the medium that we use for lan they could be coaxial cables  utp  fibers  wireless so you would note that basically most of the types of cables that we talk about find their way in some ways or other in local area networks and of course utp or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories so that cat is for categories so we could have cat3 cable cat 5cable  cat 5e cable  cat 6 cable  cat 7 cable and so on .you must have seen cat 3 cable if you looked all your telephones that is the landline phones they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of categories three for computer networking i mean cat three cables could also be used for lan although we usually prefer cat five onwards the kind of things that are on the network that could be pbx  pbx is your local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports etc ethernet is one technology which is used in lan atm is also used  fddi is sometimes used fddi if you remember is fiber distributed that is the fddi ring kind of structure so there are some networks even smaller than lan they have called personal area networks some networks so i may have be varying three or four computers and they or connected in a network on my body o we will come to pan later on but going on the other side of the spectrum that means from lan to a bigger network this is man that is a metropolitan area network typically one campus or one city may be several small towns which are closed together they would come under the preview of the man  so man by ballpark figure man would be extent of about ten kilometers  so it could be 5 kilometers or it could be twenty kilometers so something in that range  refer slide time  55  26 ? 57  48  and the kind of medium that we use for a metropolitan area networks coaxial cables both base band and broadband  we will come to this what they are sometime utp are used but that is not very preferred way of connecting although utp are used one way utp is definitely used are when you try to network to telephone lines that is i mean telephone linesi told you they use utp it could be a hybrid kind of system  some part of it could be coaxial some part of it could be utp and some part of it could be fiber fiber means  fiber optic cables and kind of things of course that kind of technology that goes into a man would be pbx different kinds of modems for example if you are using a broad band coaxial cable you might use something what is known as a cable modem  then you have this long ethernet that means on the ethernet on the over may be some lines cable tv dsl digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless one issue which is important in man is the issue of access alright that means how do you reach to each individual users.i mean think of a town or a city so you really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost ok  if it is a small building like in a lan you can take very good say utp cable to his room  now there are problems of taking utp cable to each individual house i mean there could be i mean electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost ok if you are trying to build so much copper into that is quite costly so how to access to users who are distributed over somewhat wide area in the sense of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks  refer slide time  57  49  58  41  finally at the extreme of the spectrum we have wan that is wide area network so they may stretch from ten kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers  so 10000 kilometers almost to the other side of the globe so they can involve very very long distance  medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology that is used in wan are sonet or sdh that the almost similar technology atm ip that is the internet protocol  dwdm dense wavelength division multiplexing  geo and leo geo stands for geostationary satellite is a short form of geostationary

good day today we will have the second lecture on the physical medium ; in the last lecture we have seen the different ways these digital signals and analog signals  etc can be used for communication  and how digital data or analog data can be encoded well  we are mostly interested in the digital form of data  how they can be encoded etc  and some of the general impairments of physical medium in this lecture we are going to look at specific media  which are used in networking  refer slide time  01  33 ? 01  34  refer slide time  01  34 ? 02  43  there are basically two types of media  which

first let us look at the kind of media that we use in a lan lan  as you remember  is a local area network that could vary from  let us say  1 m to 1 km so it is local strictly by its size ; 1 m means two computers connected on the same table or connected side by side ; it could be all the computers in one building and all the computers in several buildings ; and so on that is the kind of range that we have for lan the medium that we use for lan could be coaxial cables  utp  fibers  and wireless most of the types of cables that we talked about find their way in some niche or other in local area networks and  of course  utp or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories we could have cat 3 cable  cat 5 cable  cat 5e cable  cat 6 cable  cat 7 cable and so on.you must have seen cat 3 cable ? if you have looked in your telephones that is the landline phones  they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of category 3 for computer networking  cat 3 cables could also be used for lan  although we usually prefer cat 5 onwards the kind of things that are on the network could be pbx ; pbx is local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports  etc ethernet is one technology  which is used in lan ; atm is also used ; fddi is sometimes used fddi if you remember is fiber distributed  that is  the fddi ring kind of structure we have network boxes like hubs  switches  routers  etc so these are the terms you would come across of course we would talk about some of these in more detail later on  but these are some of the technologies that come into lan or local area networks  refer slide time  05  09 ? 07  22  then we come to slightly bigger networks  called man or metropolitan area networks there are some networks which are even smaller than a lan ; they are called personal area networks i may be wearing three or four computers and they are connected in network on my body so we will come to pan later on going on the other side of the spectrum  that means  from lan to bigger network  which is man  a metropolitan area network  typically one campus or one city may be several small towns  which are close together they would come under the purview of a man man is a ballpark figure ; it would extend may be about 10 kilometers ? so it could be 5 kilometers  or it could be 20 kilometers or something in that range the kind of medium that we use for metropolitan area networks is coaxial cables  both base band and broadband ; we will come to what they are sometimes utp are used but that is not a very preferred way of connecting one way where utp is definitely used is when you try to network through telephone lines utp could be a hybrid kind of system wherein some part of it could be coaxial and some part of it could be utp and some part of it could be fiber fiber means fiber optic cables the kind of technology that goes into a man would be pbx  different kinds of modems  for example if you are using a broadband coaxial cable you might use something that is known as a cable modem then you have this long-reach ethernet that means ethernet over may be some lines  cable tv dsl digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless one issue which is important in man is the issue of access that means how do you reach to each individual user ? think of it as a town or a city ; you really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost if it is a small building like in a lan you can take utp cable to his room there are problems of taking utp cables to each individual house ; there could be electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost so if you are trying to build so much copper into it that is quite costly so to access users who are distributed over a somewhat wide area of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks  refer slide time  08  32 ? 10  08  finally  at the extreme of the spectrum  we have wan  wide area network so they may stretch from 10 kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers or almost to the other side of the globe they involve very very long distances the medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology used in wan is sonet or sdh it ? s almost similar technology atm  ip ? that is the internet protocol ? dwdm  dense wavelength division multiplexing  geo and leo geo stands for geostationary satellite and leo is low art orbiting satellite so these are the kind of technologies that go into wan one issue in man is of course always cost and bandwidth  wan bandwidth because as you can imagine that when you have to take some message across hundreds of thousands of kilometers away there is a lot of cost involved in it so wan bandwidth is usually costly and we try to make the maximum use of this bandwidth of course in recent times lot of fiber has been laid internationally so the bandwidth problem is becoming less and less  but even then wan bandwidth remains costly  refer slide time  10  08 ? 12  43  now let us see some of the cable specifications that we use  first we take up this utp cable of category 5 so cat 5 utp cables specification says about 100 mhz and these can stretch up to 100 meters these are the figures which are normal  you can stretch things little bit this way or that way at times depending on your operating circumstances  etc but this is normally the figure ; so you can have some kind of idea from these the cat 5 cable looks like your standard telephone cable ; the only thing is that they are made to a slightly better specification the connector at the end of a cat 5 cable has got a specific scientific number ; this is called rj 45 so we use rj 45 connectors for connecting cat 5 cables there is a standard ansi or tia or eia standard for how cat 5 cable is to be used what are the standard ways and how they are twisted  etc there are a number of wires inside the twisted pair of cables ; so which wire stands for what  etc i simply refer to the name of the standard here  which is eia 568 a and then a cable has to be tested according to some standards ; tsb 6795 is the standard for testing cables cat 5 cable is usually under these circumstances 100 mhz to say 100 meters if you are within the 100 meters  if you have done everything properly it is expected that it can work up to 100 mbps the point is that if the distance is much less than that then naturally the same cable can work at a much higher speed so inside the same room the cat 5 cable may be used for 1000 mbps connection between computers or network nodes  refer slide time  12  43 ? 13  26  there is some enhanced version of cat 5 cable ; i will not go into the details of this  which are given over here the specifications are almost the same ; only thing is that this is slightly better in some way and it can work for 1000 base tx for small distance i said within a room if you are using cat 5 e cable instead of simple cat 5  you may be able to operate at 1000 mbps without much of a difficulty  refer slide time  13  27 ? 15  24  then we have the cat 6 cables  which is again slightly higher than cat 5 cables here  the specification is 250 mhz this specification is much higher ; so naturally cat 6 cable would be somewhat costlier than cat 5 or cat 5 e cables the same kind of connector is actually the recommended cable for operating at 1000 mbps so here is a point when networking started  people thought that 10 mbps is a fairly high speed and soon people were using networks a lot and 10 mbps was not enough  so people went to 100 mbps now people are saying that 100 mbps is slow ; so we want to go to 1000 mbps you see that in a comparatively short period of time  may be 15 ? 20 years  our demand for bandwidth has grown a thousand-fold when you are planning for an infrastructure  say copper infrastructure  in any organization or somewhere  then you should keep this in mind that whatever specification people are giving you today  after some time people may want to upgrade what i mean to say is that if you put in cat 6 kind of cables and use it for only 800 mbps today  then 1 or 2 years later you can use the same cable for 1000 mbps saving a lot of cost at that time ; but of course  that would mean a higher upfront cost today so that is always there  refer slide time  15  25 -16  44  so for testing these kind of cables there are all kinds of testing parameters i will not go to the details of these at all this is a rather technical part return loss is a measure of the reflected energy caused by impedance mismatch in the cabling system when you put a cabling system you can test it and one of the things you might test for is return loss and another thing you might test is a cross talk as reflected from the other end elfext is defined as the measure of signal coupling from a transmitter at the near end into a neighboring pair measured at the far end  relative to the received signal level on the same pair these kinds of testing parameters are there for testing copper cables similarly if we have put fiber optic cable somewhere  then fiber optic cables would have some other testing parameters it ? s a good idea to test the passive networking infrastructure  meaning all these cables and connections etc  and how they perform  refer slide time  16  45 ? 18  23  now from unshielded twisted pair cables  we go to the base band coaxial cables we have already mentioned about the base band coaxial cables these are the cables we were talking about when we talked about the bus topology if you remember ; so it is basically a shielded cable there is a copper cord surrounded by an insulating material  which is surrounded by braided outer conductor  which is surrounded again by a protective outer covering so this is considerably thicker than a utp and then in the coaxial cables also there are two varieties  the so-called thick coaxial cable and thin coaxial cable this technology is becoming obsolete now  but just for our knowledge  a thick coaxial cable is also presented as 10base5 this 10 represents that it works at 10 mbps and 5 represents that it can go up to 500 hundred meters the thin coaxial cable is 10base2  so it works at 10 mbps and goes up to 200 meters as i told you  nowadays almost everybody wants a 100 mbps to their desktop  in which case this thick and thin coaxial cables  that is the base band coaxial cables  are no longer of much use today  refer slide time  18  23 ? 20  57  but another type of coaxial cable  which is very much in vogue and which is used even today  is the kind of cable that your cable operator puts many of you have seen that cable operator puts some kind of coaxial cable into your room  which goes into your tv now it is possible to use the same infrastructure for computer communications also  i.e  computer networking also remember  i told you while discussing man that one of the most important issues in metropolitan area network is the issue of access ; that is  how do you reach each individual subscriber at his or her home ? this cable operator has reached lot of homes anyway so naturally  people started thinking whether we can use these cables from the cable operators for network communication  and special kinds of modems were designed for that called cable modem so we have a broadband cable infrastructure rather than the base band that we were talking about this is quite often used and now they are being deployed in many cities for computer communication this is  as i said  analog signal carrying tv signals and has been used for carrying data traffic older cables carry up to 450 mhz and the newer cables that have been put can go to higher frequencies  that means  higher bandwidth  and these cables use amplifiers at regular intervals now these amplifiers in the old days were only one-way amplifiers because the way the cable operators wanted it is that they are broadcasting their signal from some central location and it just has to reach people ? s tv but when you want to use this for computer communication the communication has to be two-way so the amplifier also has to be a two-way amplifier so such small technicalities are there ; it requires an amplifier at regular intervals and is a shared medium usually this medium is shared  that means  you and your neighbors ? all your data is in the same medium  refer slide time  20  57 ? 22  27  as i said  for carrying data  two-way amplification is necessary dual cable systems are like two trees  both rooted at the head-end ; the head-end is where all the service providers ? equipments etc are placed so there are all kinds of split systems  they use 5 to 30 mhz for inbound traffic and the rest for outbound traffic ; mid-split system and there are all kinds of systems for using this for data communication by the way  there is also some asymmetry that people have found in the network traffic for an average user in a city one of the most popular uses of computer network nowadays is just going onto the internet  may be surfing it  may be getting some information  etc but the amount of traffic in terms of query etc  which flows from the user to the computer  wherever it may be  is relatively small whereas you may be downloading large files  images  may be even songs  movies etc your bandwidth requirement ? the upstream bandwidth requirement and the downstream bandwidth requirement are usually not the same ; there is an asymmetry  refer slide time  22  27 ? 24  03  now we come to another very important kind of cable  having looked at copper cable  namely  optical fibers optical fiber basically is made of glass  very pure and very transparent silica glass is used  which is very very transparent in the sense that it can go up to tens of kilometers without too much of attenuation on the way so think of a glass slab  which is several kilometers thick and you can see through it quiet easily  so that kind of transparency is required so  naturally  there have to be some very strict standards for making this glass but after all  it is simply a glass  which is drawn into fiber for giving us this optical fiber at moderate dimensions  light is restricted to the fiber because of total internal reflection for ordinary light ; this is called a multimode fiber at still smaller dimensions  say something like 8 to 10 nanometers  the fiber acts like a wave guide for lasers this is known as a single-mode fiber multimode fibers are used for local area networks whereas in all wide area networks and even in local area networks these days single-mode fibres are more preferred for carrying signals  refer slide time  24  03 ? 26  55  finally what is optical networking ? one thing is  naturally  optical transmission by the way  optical transmission could be fibers or free space free space means suppose you direct a laser from the source to the destination on the free space  light will travel straight or it is expected at least to travel straight and then reach the receiver so you do not need any fiber or anything at all but there is a problem the first obvious problem is that the sender and the receiver have to be on the same line of sight without any hindrance in-between  that is one point and then there are other complications  which might come ; in the sense that the intervening air may get hot and its refractive index may change so the light may actually bend  like they do in a mirage in a desert that kind of things may happen  so it might miss the receiver altogether so free space optic communication is not very much preferred people prefer to put fiber optic cables wherever they can these cables or free space we are talking about is for fiber optic transmission then there is the question of optical switching ; can we provide the network level functionalities in the optical domain itself ? this is a topic of research these days as this is quite promising so maybe we will just look at this later on finally  why optics ? the point is that optical fiber capacity is huge  very huge ? you see 50 terabits per second is mentioned over here the point is that this has got an absolutely fantastic bandwidth  so if you can put a fiber optic connection between two endpoints your present as well as foreseable future requirements will surely be met so that is one good thing about optics the other very good thing about optics is that it is immune to electromagnetic interference  if there is a lightning strike nearby  then it is not going to affect this very thin strand of glass that we have put  which is very good because if the same thing happened to a copper cable  there would be a surge and it could maybe burn some of your equipment so this is another reason people favor fiber optics a lot  refer slide time  26  55 ? 29  27  now the point is that this 50 terabits per second bandwidth that we were talking about is only theoretical actually sometimes  i have been asked what the bandwidth of this fiber optic cable is ? this really does not make much sense because the bandwidth of any fiber optic cable you would find would ultimately be dictated by the kind of boxes that you connect to it the limitations would be there ; the limitation is not inherent in the fiber fiber can take up a huge bandwidth as i just mentioned  but at the two ends you will have some optics and then you will have some electronics now electronics can not work at that kind of speed a single piece of electronics suddenly can not work at that kind of speed ; so the overall speed at the bandwidth that you can get out of this fiber would depend on the kind of electronics that you put at the two ends that is why there is a lot of interest these days in whether some of these electronics can be replaced by optics so that we can get much higher bandwidth now not content with just sending data through only one wavelength through this fiber  we have what is known as wavelength division multiplexing that means different wavelengths of light carry different signals through the same fiber optic channel ; that is called multiplexing we will come to wdm later on with this wdm  you can get higher kind of bandwidth lucent  for example  demonstrated 64 lambda ; that means  64 different wavelengths into 40 gbps that is each of them operating at 40 gigabits per second over a distance of 4000 kilometers  so i think that is really great there are two kinds of wavelength division multiplexing  namely  coarse wavelength division multiplexing  which is somewhat cheaper  and dense wavelength division multiplexing  which is used in wan but is much more costly sothe number of wavelengths that we can use today varies from may be 8 or 12 to may be 64 or so people are working on this ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing  which can carry us to may be 100 wavelengths in the same fiber  refer slide time  29  27 ? 31  02  for a quick history  in 1958 laser was discovered then in the mid-60s guided wave optics was demonstrated  in 1970  we saw the production of low loss fibers because we want this low loss  we will be talking about this loss presently after sometime so this made long-distance optical transmission possible there was the invention of semi conductor laser diode  which was important then in 70s to 80s we used fiber in telephony in the form of sonet or sdh do not bother about what they are right now ; we will be talking about them later on in mid-80s  lans and man were sort of being put in place and in late 80s  we had a breakthrough in optically amplifying optical signals so there is edfa and rbm  dot fiber amplifier ? we will be talking about that too in this lecture itself ; and then in mid to late 90s  this dense wavelength division multiplexing system started being put and in late 90s and in 21st century optical switching systems  different components of optical switching systems are been developed all the time the point is that fiber optics has such a tremendous potential that there was a lot of interest in this and there is a lot of work going on in this area at the moment  refer slide time  31  02 ? 32  17  so here is some kind of a picture of a cross-section of a fiber optic cable as you can see  when you see a fiber optic cable  you will see this fad jacket  which is just a productive jacket made of plastic  rubber ; then inside it  there will be glass fiber but what you see is actually not the fiber ; that is also actually a cladding but that is made of glass inside this cladding there is this very fine core  which actually carries the signal in one fiber optic cable like this  you will have several such individual fibers so these are all individual fibers what has been shown over here are the individual fibers and each of them will carry one ; i have shown only 3 over here but it is typical to have something like 4 cores  8 cores  24 cores  120 cores in one cable  refer slide time  32  17 ? 34  02  let us look at this diagram of how it is so if you take a cross section  there is cladding on two sides and core in-between if you sort of cut it side ways  this is the kind of picture you get and what happens is that once the light comes into the core it sort of refracts like this and it impinges on this wall at a very wide angle of incidence there is a difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding that is always maintained so the point is that the core is at the higher refractive index and the cladding at lower refractive index there is total internal reflection over here  so even if the fiber bends a little bit ? although light usually would travel straight but through this total internal reflection it would follow this fiber ? it can take small bends and come out of the other side of the fiber but of course there are limitations to how much you can bend first of all  if you bend this core too sharply  this core will get damaged so there are limitations on what is your bending radius  radius of curvature  etc but in general to this total internal reflection the light will follow this core so this is another picture ? light is input from one end so this sort of follows the fiber and gets out of the other end  refer slide time  34  02 ? 35  02  well the light gets out  but how do you get it into something ? that means  how do you connect these fiber cables  which are actually glass fibers  how do you connect them to other things ? there are two ways of termination ; we can terminate a fiber by plugging it into a fiber socket and then sort of clamping them together we can splice them mechanically by putting the two cut ends into a sleeve and clamping them or we can fuse them to form a solid  which is a better method of connecting fibers even when you fuse them what will happen is there will be some kind of disturbance ? that glass material will not be totally homogenous at the junction so there will still be some loss but this loss is quite low if you are very careful in this splicing  referred slide time  35  02 ? 35  27  and what about light sources ? we have two different light sources ; they are called semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes naturally  the first one gives out lasers whereas the other one  the simple leds  give non-coherent lights so they are simple leds both have their advantages and disadvantages  refer slide time  35  27 ? 37  19  when you are using the semi-conductor laser ? laser as you know is coherent light and simple led gives you non-coherent light ? so the data rate for lasers can be much higher with lasers and this is low fiber type you can use multimode fibers over here and you can use single mode fibers we prefer single mode fibres for lasers the distance that an led can cover is short whereas the distance that single mode fibers  that means lasers  can travel through a single mode fiber is really long so all our long-distance cables are actually single mode types and they carry laser since we are going to higher and higher speed all the time  we tend to prefer single mode fibers these days of course  led has a very long life so this is one area in which led is definitely better whereas laser ? s lifetime seems to be short  although not very short if proper care is taken  they will certainly run for several years the temperature sensitivity for led is minor so for semiconductor laser it is substantial  so its life source has to be maintained at a particular temperature led naturally is low cost and laser is more expensive these are the pros and cons of the two sources  refer slide time  37  19 ? 39  06  let us took take a closer look at the kind of losses that we have in fiber remember  when we were discussing about electrical transmission through some copper medium ? we were talking about it in the last class ? there are several kinds of distortion to the signal first of all  the signal strength tends to weaken as we go over a longer and longer distance ; that is called attenuation the same thing happens in the case of fiber also  in the sense that as we go further and further the signal will get weakened you can look at this way that if the signal did not weaken  then we can look through a glass of any thickness that is not true ; the transparency of the glass  although it is very highly transparent  is not 100 %  that is why as it travels down the fiber its strength will become lower and not only that  it will also get its wave shape and also get somewhat distorted due to certain phenomena for example  there is this phenomena of rayleigh scattering ; that means due to slight changes in the refractive index of the glass some of the light will get scattered then there are other kinds of scattering called mie scattering due to the imperfection of the cylindrical structure these losses are non uniform for different wavelengths that is why on the other end your signal will arrive first of all weakened  and secondly in a slightly distorted fashion  refer slide time  39  06 ? 40  09  this figure  this famous figure  is the plot of the loss that will happen to a light signal at different wavelengths as you can see  this loss in the fiber  given in db per kilometer  is not uniform you can see that it is not uniform across all the wavelengths so there are some wavelengths  namely here  where the loss is very low then there are other wavelengths where the loss is quiet high what we do is that we try to find some kind of windows  where the loss would be low and we can go to high distance because  remember that if the loss is low  refer slide time  40  09 ? 41  17  we can go much longer without any amplification or repeated kind of action and that is good i mean that would make the thing cheaper and of course we would be able to carry data for longer distance these are the three useful windows so to say  one is the 850 nanometer window  the other is the 1300 nanometer window  and another is the 1550 nanometer window around these wavelengths  if we send our signal  it will go a long way so these are the three windows  which are used for data transmission because of the very high frequencies involved ? you can look at the frequencies from these wavelengths  you can calculate and you will see that the frequencies are very high ? it can potentially have a very huge bandwidth so the theoretical capacity of the fiber is very high ; it is limited by the optoelectronic devices and boxes at the two ends  refer slide time  41  17 ? 43  23  now let us see if we want to take the fiber optic signal to a long distance ; naturally  i mean whatever window you use after some distance depending on the kind of source you are using  the kind of frequency you are using  the quality of fiber you are using  it may be 5 kilometers or it may be 50 kilometers but when you are going thousands of kilometers  at some point of time the signal will become very weak so you need some kind of repeater function what is the repeater ? the incoming signal may amplify or make the shape all right ; so there are all kinds of repeaters repeaters are different gates ; there are some repeaters  which simply amplify the signal there are other repeaters  which can also make corrections to the shape of the incoming signal  etc you need this repeater function in order to go to a very large distance so we will just take a look at this interesting phenomenon  how do you repeat optical signals ? optical signals traveling for long distances through fiber need to be strengthened this may be done through olts ; now what is an olt ? that is optical line transmitter  which takes the signal to the electronic domain and  of course  you can use a fresh source over there to make a nice and strong wave form and push it for the next leg of its journey the important thing is that this may also be done in the optical domain and the advantage of doing it in the optical domain is that you are no longer restricted by the bandwidth limitations of electronics so you can really operate at very high speed always in the optical domain and one way to do that is with  refer slide time  43  24 ? 43  58  erbium doped fiber amplifiers so erbium has a large number of excited states and from some of the excited states it gives out 1550 nanometer light  exactly the wavelength used in the third window in the glass so a few meters of optical fiber are doped ; that means a small quantity of this erbium is introduced in that ; the glass is doped with the few parts per million of erbium and is pumped with 1480 or 980 nanometer laser  to give amplification so what would happen is  refer slide time  43  58 ? 44  39  you look at this suppose this is the ordinary fiber  which is carrying the signal and there is some portion of it which is doped with erbium and a pump laser of certain frequency is fed into this so what will happen is that the erbium atoms in this region will be in an excited state  so erbium will be in a excited state when a signal photon comes  this sort of induces the erbium to come down to the ground state  giving an amplified signal so this is a very simplified version of how erbium doped amplification is used  refer slide time  44  39 ? 44  57  there are other kinds of this ; depending on what kind of pump laser you are using  you may go to this kind of excited state or this kind of excited state from which you can go to excited state one and so on but anyway  the basic idea remains the same  refer slide time  44  57 ? 45  38  because of dispersion  that is chromatic dispersion and polarization  mode dispersion wave shaping is necessary after some distance there are other kinds of combination of wave forms known as solitons ; these are waves shaped specially to match the dispersion characteristics of fiber so that a soliton would not be distorted for a long distance distortion can also be counteracted by reverse fiber so all kinds of technology are there ; we do not have the time to go into the details of these  but this is a very up-coming and growing field  refer slide time  45  38 ? 46  25  once again  why do we like fiber ? ? because repeaters are needed only every 50 to 100 kilometers as opposed may be 2 to 5 kilometers for copper ; not affected by power surges  electromagnetic interference  power failures  corrosive chemicals  etc ; communication in a fiber is usually simplex that means there is the source on one end  receiver on the other end  so in one fiber the data is really going in one direction so for two-way communication  we require a pair of fibers  but these two fibers have more capacity than 1000 strands of twisted pair  and that is really really great  refer slide time  46  27 ? 47  05  we will have just one quick look at where fibers are going ? people are putting fiber at a feverish pitch now one is the ultra long hall ? ultra long hall means we have fiber for a distance of may be thousands of kilometers then in the long hall we have this wdm or sonet  sgas etc  which is put by the telecom company or other communications companies then we have the wdm  atm  sonet  ethernet  etc in the metro  that means  within the same city  and now finally fiber is finding its way in the access side ? that means to individual users also  refer slide time  47  05 ? 47  41  these are the different ways fibers can reach your home  which is the ultimate goal of networking either you can take individual fibers to homes or we can take them to a switch  which is placed in the neighborhood and from there individual fibers go to every home there is also a concept of passive optical networking in that instead of keeping a switch out in the open  you put a passive sort of splitter  which splits the signal into so many parts so pon  passive optical network  is another possibility  refer slide time  47  41 ? 48  22  let us come to the other most important physical medium  namely  wireless one disadvantage of each of the data transmission methods that we have seen so far is that they are all wired connections moving from a wired connection to a wireless connection results in the ability to connect a network without having a physical connection what is the great advantage of that ? the greatest advantage of course is mobility that means if you are connected in a wireless fashion  you can move around but still remain connected  refer slide time  48  22 ? 49  24  this entire electromagnetic spectrum is used for communication this just shows a picture of that on the low end we have the radio  followed by microwave  which is of a higher frequency  followed by infrared  which is of still higher frequency then we have the visible light ; of course we talked about the fiber optics and this part has not been used for communication as yet  may be in future these are the kind of frequencies we have so the frequency range is tremendous ? from 104 or may be 1014 or 1015 or so we have these twisted pairs in this region  coaxial cables  maritime signaling  am radio  fm radio  tv  terrestrial microwave  satellite  fiber optics by the way  radio  and sometimes tv also  terrestrial microwave  satellite are all used for computer communication also  refer slide time  49  24 ? 49  40  these are the different names for the different ranges  we have lf for low frequency  medium frequency  high frequency  very high frequency  ultra high frequency  super high frequency  extremely high frequency  and so on  refer slide time  49  40 ? 50  08  transmitting data  data is transmitted through a wave just as with coax ; that means the higher the frequency  the more the data that can be encoded and transmitted narrow band is often used as the number of watts/hertz is high  and there are different pros and cons at different frequency bands we will just look at some of them  refer slide time  50  08 ? 50  35  sometimes a wide band is used ; using a wide band allows the transmitter to jump from one frequency to another in order to avoid communication jams and to hide detection that is just one example and this is nowadays used in ieee 802.11  which is a wireless lan standard we will look at this later on bluetooth is another wireless lan standard  refer slide time  50  35 ? 51  20  to start at the low end of the spectrum  at the radio transmission  this is very easy to generate  travels long distances and it is omni directional ; that means you have an omni directional antenna and you send your signal over there so it will travel in all directions and it will reach everybody around in a certain area that will not happen if you are using a very high frequency like microwave ; so at low frequencies  waves go to walls and power falls off sharply with distance from the source at high frequencies waves will bounce off of obstacles  refer slide time  51  20 ? 51  34  so there is a limit to the distance that a radio wave can cover vlf  lf  and mf bands are limited by distance on the ground high-frequency and very high-frequency waves can be bounced off the ionosphere  sending it back to earth  which is a very important thing  refer slide time  51  35 ? 52  01  this is a picture of what might happen in short-wave range ? you know the short wave radio ? you can listen to the radio transmission from usa what is happening is that it is getting repeatedly reflected off the ionosphere and reaching the other end of the earth  refer slide time  52  01 ? 52  23  there are problems with this wireless communication ; we will not go into all the details first of all there will be selective kind of attenuation  then there is a very irritating thing called multipath fading so what happens is   refer slide time  52  23 ? 52  47  for example  something like this  your signal may reach directly or your signal may reach through a path after getting reflected somewhere and these two may be out of phase so when they are out of phase  they will sort of cancel each other and you will have a very bad signal these are the problems we encounter in mobile phones  etc so you have to do something about these  refer slide time  52  47 ? 53  21  for microwave transmission  the transmission can be very narrowly focused so data can be moved from one tower to another you may have seen those microwave towers ; so they are sort of in line of sight with each other alignment is important because this is a focused beam if it is not aligned  your receiver will miss the signal altogether beams do not pass through buildings well these are the disadvantages of microwave if the waves are delayed  they may arrive out of sync  which is known as multipath fading  refer slide time  53  21 ? 54  13  finally  we have infrared and millimeter waves at the very high end of these ; of course  we have talked about optical fiber they are mainly used for short-range communication and they are strictly directional as we are going more towards the light  it is becoming more and more directed  as light is very directed so they are directional  cheap  and easy to use but they don ? t pass through solid objects you can not use them for a mobile phone  let us say  but you can use them for controlling your tv or for short-range connection to your computer from some handheld device  etc so this can be an advantage or disadvantage ? one way of looking at it is that since it does not go through walls  whatever you do in one room is going to not affect whatever you are doing in the other room so that may be an advantage also we tried to cover all the different ranges that we use in communication ; we have the satellites also as i mentioned  you have this geostationary satellites  which are nothing but repeaters on the sky  refer slide time  54  36 ? 54  50  so we can sort of send the signal from earth to the satellite  where it will be amplified and sent it back to earth these satellites could be geostationary or the satellites could be sort of low  earth orbiting satellites so they are also used for communication over long distances  refer slide time  55  00 ? 55  10  note  the rest is part of lec 5 faculty name prof sujoy ghosh lecture no # 5 multiplexing  shareing a medium  today we will talk about multiplexing  refer slide  55  27 55  34  multiplexing is about sharing a medium that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  55  42 ? 59  54  another simplest condition a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garble but for multiple signals can share one medium the medium must somehow be divided giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember that a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this band width is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned so what we tried to do is that we tried to use this bandwidth some how to to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers so that is the idea of multiplexing  refer slide time  56  34 ? 56  43  these line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company and most data devices individually the require modest amount of data but when the when a number of users their requirement are aggregated together the sum total may be quite substantial band width  refer slide time  56  55 ? 57  10  the current technique accomplish this includes frequency division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing we will look at many of some of these at least  refer slide time  57  10 57  55  let us see so this is the scheme of multiplexing you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link and on the other side depending on in which fashion you have put them together they started separated in two different lines so these now these different lines in the right they can now go to different recipients so just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here so the so a number of sender receiver pair is utilizing the same physical link in  refer slide time  57  57 ? 58  12  now to for the types of multiplexer as i mentioned that we have fdm that is the frequency division multiplexing  tdm that is the time division multiplexing  stdm that is the statistical time division multiplexing so we will look at these  refer slide time  58  11 ? 58  36  just quickly before we go into get into the details of each of these time division multiplexing each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else so we will look at the details of this later  refer slide time  58  37 ? 58  38  computers networks prof  sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology iit kharagpur lecture  5 multiplexing  sharing a medium   refer slide time  00  53  good day today we will talk about multiplexing  refer slide  00  56  1  08  multiplexing is about sharing a medium ; that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  1  09  2  13  under the simplest condition  a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there  they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garbled ; but for multiple signals to share one medium  the medium must somehow be divided  giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember  a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned we try to use this bandwidth to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers that is the idea of multiplexing there are various reasons we want to use multiplexing   refer slide time  2  15  3  20  and the chief one is that transmission service is very expensive ? leased line  packet switching networks  etc for example  laying of lines is in itself fairly expensive and a complex proposition and once you lay a line you like to utilize it to the maximum if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication  multiplexing and compression techniques are the techniques  which we use for this purpose ? it saves a lot of money for the business when you can send a lot of data through the same line  the data capacity of the line increases  it becomes more cost-effective for the company ; most data devices individually require modest amount of data but when there are a number of users  their requirements are aggregated together and the sum total may be of quite a substantial bandwidth  refer slide time  3  21  3  32  the current techniques that can accomplish this include  frequency division multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing  and code division multiplexing we will look at some of these  at least  refer slide time  3  33  4  19  this is the scheme of multiplexing ; you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side these n inputs have come to the same multiplexer ; they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link and on the other side  depending on the fashion in which you have put them together  they have separated into different lines these different lines on the right can now go to different recipients so just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers  a number of sender ? receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in-between  refer slide time  4  20  5  01  the alternative to multiplexing should be direct point-to-point connection ; this has a number of problems the first problem is that you need those lines that we were talking about  you need lines for each device  and you need a large amount of wiring  if they are on different floors another important point is that you need a lot of i/o ports on the computer side  which really is not feasible you may have a few i/o ports  but you can not have hundreds of i/o ports  it ? s really difficult to have hundreds of i/o ports there that is also another bottleneck that we wish to address  refer slide time  5  02  5  22  another approach could be  a somewhat older approach  which is that of a multi-drop line the host polls machines to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines  saves i/o port ; the total communications load is not greater than the data rate of line  refer slide time  5  23  5  42  these are actually the simple approaches using a multiplexer approach  all the devices  their data is multiplexed on one side  sent through one line  and the number of lines in is equal to the number of lines out ; the link carries multiple channels of information  refer slide time  5  43  5  59  the types of multiplexer we have are  fdm  that is  frequency division multiplexing ; tdm  that is  time division multiplexing ; stdm  that is  statistical time division multiplexing we will look at these  refer slide time  6  0  6  26  just quickly before we get into the details of each of these  in time-division multiplexing  each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time  for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else ? s time we will look at the details of this later  refer slide time  6  26  6  51  another common approach is the frequency division multiplexing ; here the frequency spectrum is divided among the logical channels here we have only one physical channel  but we want to have a number of logical channels  so the frequency spectrum of the channel is divided  each user has exclusive access to his channel  refer slide time  6  52  8  52  this fdm sends signals in several distinct frequency ranges  one of the oldest uses of frequency division multiplexing is in radio for example  we have this electromagnetic field in our atmosphere  let us say  through which electromagnetic radiation can pass electromagnetic radiation can be of very large range of bandwidth  the whole range of bandwidth is there out of that  the so-called radio frequencies constitute one part of it  a fairly important part of it this whole bandwidth of radio frequencies is divided into small channels and each channel is given to one particular station and on the receiver side  on the radio side  what we do is that we tune our radio  let us say  to one particular frequency  so that it receives signal from that particular station only ; although a number of stations are all transmitting at the same time this is an example of multiplexing another example of multiplexing  the same frequency division multiplexing  we see nowadays in the cable tv the cable tv providers give one cable  one coaxial cable to the premise connected to the tv that one coaxial cable apparently is carrying a number of channels  may be hundreds of channels these days what is done once again is that  all the frequencies  which can travel down this cable  are broken into a number of logical channels and each channel is dedicated to one particular station that is how we carry multiple video channels on a single cable  refer slide time  8  53  10  10  of course i mean point-to-point is out of question imagine the cost of stringing wire for each channel ; you ? ll have a hundred cables coming into your building which is not really possible each signal is modulated on to a different carrier frequency ; carrier frequencies are separated by guard bands this guard band is important because one particular channel  maybe a radio channel or a tv channel  the principle is the same everywhere so  that uses some middle frequency  maybe some range of frequencies the next station maybe a tv station or a radio station ? whatever it is  that can occupy ; first of all that has to be non-overlapping the range of frequencies which is assigned to the second station has to be non-overlapping with the range of frequencies which is given to the first station and not only that  between these two there must be some separation in frequencies otherwise what will happen is these two signals are going to interfere with each other so that is a guard band  refer slide time  10  11  10  17  the bandwidth of the transmission medium exceeds required bandwidth of all signals because of these guard bands which have to come in-between  refer slide time  10  18  11  02  usually for frequency division multiplexing  analog signaling is used to transmit signals broadcast radio and television  cable television and amps cellular phone system use frequency division multiplexing amps is an old cellular phone system that was there in usa nowadays of course  the kind of cellular technology that we have in our country uses more complex multiplexing techniques  maybe i ? ll mention that later on these systems all use frequency division multiplexing this technique is the oldest of the multiplexing techniques  refer slide time  11  03  11  22  assignment of non-overlapping frequency ranges to each user or signal on a medium ? all signals are transmitted at the same time  each using different frequencies a multiplexer accepts inputs and assigns frequencies to each device  refer slide time  11  21  12  07  the multiplexer is attached to a high-speed communications line because all these frequency bands on individual users are going to adapt to a fat range of frequencies the communication line must be able to handle this whole frequency range or in other words  the communication line has to be high speed a corresponding multiplexer or demultiplexer is on the end of the high-speed line and separates the multiplexed signals  because on the other end you have to separate them out since it involves analog signaling  it is more susceptible to noise thus we have seen that the analog signals are more susceptible to noise in digital signals we can sort of clean the noise more easily  refer slide time  12  08  12  52  this is a diagram if you note that for a particular user  suppose user 1  we give channel 1 ; along the time this channel 1 is entirely dedicated to user 1 for all time similarly channel 2  which is at a different frequency ? frequency is on this side and time is on this side ? once again user 2 gets to use this frequency for the whole time this is the simplest kind of scheme  so that for this whole frequency band  frequency is being divided  which is why it is called frequency division multiplexing  refer slide time  12  52  13  13  as was mentioned  the frequency channel is divided into logical channels ; each user hangs on to a particular frequency  the radio spectrum and a radio are examples of the media and the mechanism of extending information from the media  refer slide time  13  13  12  07  this is another picture of the same thing  see channel 1 and then channel 2  channel 3 ? they all send some signals if you plot them across the frequency versus the signal strength  you get a picture like this  so this is the first channel  this is the second channel and this is the third channel in-between this part here is the so-called guard band this frequency is not used by either of them there is some overlapping due to noise and other issues ; we will not get into that ; due to that this is what it looks like  the frequency bands are all separated  refer slide time  14  05  14  47  here is another diagram which shows  let ? s say you have the host and a 300 bps line ; a number of 300 bits per second lines are being multiplexed to 1200 bps line and then there are some guard bands  maybe 300 to 1013 hz is one and then 1433 to 2206 hz is another line ; maybe 2686 to 3400 hz is another line these are the 300 bps sub-channels and you have the guard bands in-between on the other side again you have this multiplexer ? demultiplexer  which takes it to different users  refer slide time  14  48  15  35  one problem with fdm is that it can not utilize the full capacity of the cable it is important that the frequency bands do not overlap so that is why you have to give the guard bands  so the full capacity of the cable is not utilized the other disadvantage ? we will summarize these advantages and disadvantages later on ? is that it is sort of bit more prone to noise because we are dealing with analog signals fdm is usually used to carry analog signals although modulated digital signals can also be sent using this technique  refer slide time  15  35  16  22  we have another type of multiplexing  which is wavelength division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing is the same as the frequency division multiplexing only thing is that here the operating frequencies are much higher  actually they are in the optical range ; that is why somehow it is given different name like wavelength division multiplexing  you know different wavelengths means different frequencies if you are doing wavelength division it is same as doing frequency division and this is used in optical fibers this is the same as fdm but applied to fibers  refer slide time  16  23  17  08  there ? s a great potential for fibers since the bandwidth is very huge as i mentioned  the operating frequencies are very high  even a slight percentage diviation from the mean operating frequency gives you a very large bandwidth so you can sort of compact or pack a lot of channels at those high frequencies fibers have a large bandwidth capacity and with different energy bands are passed through a diffraction grating prism combined on the long distant link and then split at the destination this is got high reliability as well as high capacity  two very interesting properties  refer slide time  17  08  18  23  so multiplexing and demultiplexing for a wavelength division multiplexing is of course very simple if you take a prism  you know if you send a white light through a prism it breaks up into all the different colours  because the refractive index of the prism varies with the frequency so different frequency can come in  you can make the same light source also to say in this and on the other side you can use a prism to break it up of course i have shown a prism here for simplicity ; usually something like a diffraction grating is used so if you look at the fiber spectrum  if you plot the power versus the frequency so one fiber maybe giving at this frequency  another fiber maybe delivering power at this frequency if you put them together simply then you get this power versus ? or power versus ?  kind of plot that you get  refer slide time  18  24  19  37  wavelength division multiplexing multiplexes multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic line different wavelength lasers called ? s ; traditionally ? is used for denoting a wavelength  some are quite extensively used in this optical communication domain different frequencies are called different ? s and they transmit multiple signals each signal carried on the fiber can be transmitted at a different rate from the other signals this is one very interesting thing of fiber that is  different colours although they may get mixed but finally again they will be separated what rate of data  what protocol etc are they carrying ? the fiber system is really transparent to all that so that is a good thing ? different systems can be put to the same fiber as i mentioned that fiber have a very high capacity so you get to push in a lot of channels into the same fiber  refer slide time  19  39  21  09  dense wavelength division multiplexing also called dwdm they may combine as many as 30  40  50  60 or more channels these days into one fiber and each of these channels has a very high capacity ; so dwdm channel has a very high capacity and it is improving all the time people are finding ways of packing more ? s into the same fiber and it is supposed to be quite scalable into the future ; but of course if you want to pack those wavelengths in a very dense fashion  your equipment becomes somewhat costly a cheaper alternative which has come up recently which are called cwdm so dense wavelength division multiplexing is called dwdm  cheaper version is called coarse wavelength division multiplexing or cwdm in this cwdm the channels are more widely spaced on the spectrum multiplexer  demultiplexer  and all these costs go down and become cheaper alternatives but still you can push in a number of wavelengths into the same fiber now we come to the other very important multiplexing technique called time division multiplexing  refer slide time  21  10  22  10  as a matter of fact this is extensively used in our computer communication or telecommunication time division multiplexing is very extensively used especially on the service provider side ; we will look at these later on sharing of the signal is accomplished in time division multiplexing by dividing the available transmission time on a medium among users ; so time is being divided what is done is that  as i mentioned before  that each user gets a small burst of time in which at that time the entire channel and the entire bandwidth is at his disposal ; but as soon as that short duration of time is over  then it is somebody else ? s turn to send and this maybe in a round-robin fashion after some time it will come back to the original user  so that he can send his next burst of data or voice or whatever it is  refer slide time  22  12  22  40  usually we use digital signaling in time division multiplexing  almost always digital signaling is used almost exclusively time division multiplexing comes in two basic forms  one is synchronous time division multiplexing  the other is statistical or asynchronous time division multiplexing we will look at synchronous time division multiplexing first and because that is the simpler scheme and then you will look at statistical multiplexing  refer slide time  22  41  23  42  so the same multiplexing scheme now looks like this if this is the frequency  the same plot if you remember in the previous diagram when we were doing tdm we were slicing this channel in this fashion we are now slicing it in this fashion ; that means time is divided ; channel 1 channel 2  channel 3  channel 4  channel 5  channel 6 ; they get the entire frequency range for a small burst of time and suppose only 6 channels are being multiplexed  after 6 again it will be the turn of channel 1 so channel 1 sends the first burst of data etc using the entire frequency band during this time period and then during this time period during this time channel 1 is not sending anything so it is quiescent time is getting divided in this fashion  this is why this is called time division multiplexing  refer slide time  23  45  25  23  this is a schematic of a time division multiplexing system like fdm time division multiplexing saves money by allowing more than one telephone call to use a cable at the same time you have terminal 1  terminal 2 and terminal 3 terminal 1 is giving at this particular time then terminal 2 and this terminal 3 and over here on the other side this sequence and the way it goes that is known that has to be known ; so whatever signal comes at one particular slot ; this multiplexer knows that this must be for receiver number 1 and next slot is for receiver number 2 and next slot for receiver number 3 so on the receiver side  it just knows if it is this time slot  it is for a particular user this is a synchronous division multiplexing because this clock and this clock have to be synchronized otherwise  there will be a problem instead of dividing the cable frequency bands  tdm splits cable usage into time slots each channel is given a regular time slot in which to send a pcm signal  refer slide time  25  25  27  41  this is another view of the same time division multiplexing actually in actual practice  we will go into the details of this later on actually this time division multiplexing can be done in a hierarchy of manner we will look at this hierarchy later on if you remember from our digital signals discussion  that our voice  because it is up to say 4 khz is our voice signal  because of nyquist theorem  we require 8 kilo samples ; that means double the rate  that means 8,000 samples/second for capturing voice and for each sample  it has to be converted each sample is an analog value ; so that value has to be converted to a digital signal  an 8 bit digital signal  which is called pcm ? pulse coded modulation that means there are 256 different levels that this is distributing  which is very fine our amplitude of voice if you divide it into 256 parts we are making a very fine distinction ; that gives you 8 bits per sample 8,000 samples/second ; that comes to 64,000 bits per/second this is a very basic rate and this rate has got a name ; we will go to these names later on a number of such channels may be multiplexed together this 64,000 bits/second is a very basic rate a number of such channels may be grouped together to form one particular higher level channel and different higher lever channels may again join together to make a hierarchy of channels  this is what is shown over here  refer slide time  27  41  28  38  these t1 etc  don ? t bother about this figure at this moment because we will look at this later on so t1 is one particular rate at which some of these signals come there are world wide standards actually there are two standards  we will talk about it later on standards of the rate at which these signals come ; they sort of join together and form a stream of t2 stream and different t2 streams  different waves have different names like t1  t2  t3  etc  will form a t3 kind of frame and as you can see that the bandwidth is increasing all the time the t1 rate is 1.544 mb/second  refer slide time  28  38  32  10  time division multiplexing used for digital signals or analog signals carrying digital data  data rate of transmission media exceeds data rate of signals ; so this has to be there otherwise your tdm system will not work because in that small burst of time which is given to a particular user  in that burst of time that user should be able to send whatever digital data it had accumulated during that time  as well as the previous epoch during which it was quiescent ; because at that time it was other people ? s turn it may be a buffer or kind of thing where all these bits are getting accumulated and when it gets its small burst of time  during that burst of time it sends all the bits in that buffer  to make it empty and then it becomes quite again  so it will accumulate the bits again in the buffer and then again when it gets the next burst of time it will send all the bits thus data rate of transmission media has to exceed data rate of signals it uses a frame ; frame means a number of bits and bytes put together to form one particular unit at which to send it over ; one slot for each slice of time what would happen is that a slow device during his slot will send a lower number of bits ; very high-speed device will send a large number of bits  but your slot will come periodically one or more slots of each device is equal to channel and time slots are transmitted whether source has data or not this is one particular problem with time division multiplexing think about this ? that on the receiving side  receiver side is blind ; it does not know this stream of bits which has come is for whom the only way he knows that this is the time slot for receiver i  so he will send those bits to receiver i and so on in a round robin fashion what happens is  suppose the senders are s1  s2 to sn  receivers are also s1  s2 to sn ; and then we have this the si will be sending to ri ; what happens if si has nothing to send at that point of time ? during that time it is not possible for the multiplexer or the demultiplexer  in the normal scheme of things  to send somebody else maybe sj ? s signal during that time although physically it would be possible ; but then on the demultiplexing side it would cause a problem because the demultiplexer would not know whether this bit is for ri or rj that is why even if si has nothing to send  that slot will have to run empty ; you can not utilize it any further this is the weakness of time division multiplexing which we try to sort of address in a different scheme  we will be talking about just now  refer slide time  32  11  32  33  the synchronous time division multiplexing  remember that it is synchronous because the multiplexer and the demultiplexer has to agree about the slot of time ; the original time division multiplexing  the multiplexer accepts input from attached devices in a round robin fashion and transmit t1 and isdn telephone lines are common examples of synchronous time division multiplexing  refer slide time  32  34  33  01  if one device generates data at a faster rate than other devices  then the multiplexer must either sample the incoming data stream from that device more often than it samples the other devices or buffer the faster incoming stream if a device has nothing to transmit the multiplexer must still insert a piece of data from that device into the multiplexed stream  it may be a dummy data  refer slide time  33  02  34  08  before i talk about the other kind of tdm  which is the statistical time division multiplexing  i must mention that there are hybrid multiplexing schemes also that means in the hybrid scheme  what you do is that you take a frequency band ; it is like frequency division multiplexing  so you break up your entire available channels into a number of bands ; but each of the bands instead of in the pure fdm  we are giving it to only one user but this band is allotted to may be a number of users who use tdm on this band this is a combination of fdm and tdm  so such kind of hybrid multiplexing systems are quite widely used in these days and one good example is the cell phone communication that goes on ; that may use hybrid kind of multiplexing systems  refer slide time  34  10  34  21  in hybrid multiplexing system  both fdm and tdm may be combined ; the available channel is broken up into frequency bands ; in each band multiple channels are accommodated through tdm  refer slide time  34  22  36  38  now we talk about the other kind of time division multiplexing  namely  statistical multiplexing this is time division but on demand rather than fixed  so we reschedule link on a per packet basis and packets from different sources are interweaved on the link remember that i mentioned the disadvantage of time division multiplexing is that even if the sender does not have to send anything  that time slot will go empty we can not utilize it because otherwise on the demultiplexer side we will not be able to decipher who it is in the pure time division multiplexing this is to be addressed in statistical time division multiplexing or stdm ; what is done is that the packets are sent on demand ; that means if somebody has to send and the channel is free  it will be sent of course if everybody has to send  then you have to once again do some kind of scheduling in a round robin fashion in a simple vanilla case or you can do more fancy kind of scheduling i am not going into that so this utilizes the channel in a much more efficient manner ; but you have a problem we know what the problem is ? the problem is on the demultiplexer side on the demultiplexer side  one particular time slot being allotted to one particular sender or a receiver  that relationship is no longer there  and if that relationship is no longer there  how do we make out on the other side whether this is meant for whom ? so you have to have that address inside that data stream that means inside the data stream  there must be something which tells the receiver and the demultiplexer that this is meant for that receiver so you have to have the address  at least the destination address in the packet so to say  now i am calling it a packet that what ever the burst of data sent in a particular time slot  refer slide time  36  41  38  20  it allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit how is this possible ? this is because usually our communication is always bursting  for example  when i am talking i may require 4 khz  when i am making a sound ; but then there are periods when i am quiescent that means i ? m not talking at all .so overall if i can utilize that  maybe my effective rate of utilization of the channel will become more than 4 khz ; because one user is using 4 khz and this way in each of the channels  the same thing happens and much more dramatically  in the world of sending and receiving data data traffic is inherently bursting  which means that one computer is communicating with other computer  this will do so in bursts it will want to send a lot of stuff ; suddenly it has something to send  so it will want to send it fast in a burst then for a long time it will be quiet  as there will be nothing because it will go there  maybe get processed over there  maybe some user sees it  sees that data  and things like that so it is quiet for a long time  then again it sends another burst and in-between these bursts there is a lot of time while the burst is there  i am using at a very high speed but then other people can share it  so that is why in some sense it allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit  refer slide time  38  21  39  00  this works on the premise that not all nodes will transmit at full capacity at all times ; must transmit a terminal identification  as i said the destination identification has to be there ; and may require storage because two different sources may want to send at the same time and both of them land up hoping that the channel will be free i am calling it a multiplexer at this point  at the multiplexer end you have to store them and then forward them over the channels  and then the channel becomes available  refer slide time  39  01  39  56  this is a picture of once again getting multiplexed ? they are getting multiplexed as they come this is the queue in-between and you have this buffer over here  this is the memory where the incoming packets are getting stored and they are making a queue so there are a number of packets here and from this queue one by one as they come  it is not necessary that they have to go in a strict round robin fashion ; as they arrive they have are being pumped into this transmission channel on this side  on the demultiplexing side  it will look at some receiver address which is contained within this packet or cell  whatever it is  and then send it to the proper receiver  refer slide time  39  57  40  47  the buffer packets that are contending for the link  the packet queue may be processed first in and out  but as i said this is the most vanilla kind of scheme ; there are other fancy schemes for example you may have a high-priority queue for some of the users who may be paying more ? that queue is processed first before the other queues and all kinds of possibilities are there but of course since you have a buffer  it is theoretically possible and since your capacity of the link can not handle if all the senders decide to send at the same time  which may happen  in which case it will be filling it in the buffer  but the buffer may also overflow  which means that there is a congestion in the network and then some data loss is there  refer slide time  40  48  41  16  to summarize  a statistical multiplexer transmits only the data from active work stations if a work station is not active  no space is wasted on the multiplexed stream ; a statistical multiplexer accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame containing only the data to be transmitted and also as i said this frame will also contain the some kind of destination address  refer slide time   41  16  45  41  this is an example to identify each piece of data and the address is included so the data of c as well as address of c  data of a as well as address of a ? the address also has to go with the data this of course is under the assumption that all these data packets and these addresses  together all these packet lengths are fixed  which is the case in some systems like atm  etc the size is fixed but the size may vary also  if the size varies then you will have to include the length of a also  that means this is the data of a ; what is the total length of a or maybe the data part  if this part is fixed depending on the scheme then the address to which this is destined all these are put in the form of a frame and then it is sent finally i would like to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each of the schemes by the way  in the beginning i mentioned something called code division multiplexing  which is a very interesting scheme we will talk about code division multiplexing when we talk about multiple access there are actually two terms ; one is multiplexing and the other is multiple access usually this is how we mean it but distinction is getting blurred these days ; usually when you are multiplexing  the sources are sort of converged to the multiplexer in some sense the sources are converged to the multiplexer in some sense and it goes to the demultiplexer where it diverges there is a specific convergence which is there  that means a number of telephone lines are getting multiplexed ; a number of telephone lines will come to the local telephone exchange there these may be all destined for some other exchange  so all these lines will be multiplexed together so they are happening physically in one place if the problem is this  then once again you have a shared medium but the users are distributed in that case we call it a multiple access system cdma is a multiple access system as well as you can in some sense call it a multiplexing system also as i said this distinction is slowly getting blurred these days ; for example  you are doing some kind of multiplexing when you come to cell phones we are doing some hybrid kind of multiplexing ; that means we have got a combination of fdm and tdm ; i.e  we have some bands of frequencies which are being used by a number of users ; but these users are not at the same place they are carrying some wireless station that means they are carrying their mobile handsets and are at various locations even for the same base station  under the same base station  they are at various locations in that area so to say thus the distinction between multiplexing and multiple access is getting a little blurred these days anyway we will discuss code division multiplexing or multiple access when we talk about other kinds of multiple access as you can guess  there is time division multiple access and then there is frequency division multiple access and then of course this code division multiple access is also there ; so we will discuss it there  refer slide time  45  43  48  20  coming back to the scheme that we discussed  namely  fdm  what are the advantages and good things about each of these schemes ? fdm is of course simple and being simple means that it is cheap and is very popular  and as i mentioned this is the oldest multiplexing technique your radio uses this and lots of other systems use this tdm is specifically for digital signals  so for digital signals tdm is very nice and then you can have a multiplexing hierarchy ; that is another advantage of tdm why it is an advantage ? well the advantage is because of this  at different places we may require different levels of bandwidth and speed just think about this ? suppose we have this telephone network  you may have a small exchange ; the small exchange will naturally have a small number of users and only a few of those users will want to communicate or make an std call or to communicate with some other telephone  which is under some other exchange so the few will have to be multiplexed together at the small exchange and it will be sent to the trunk exchange and from there it may go to another trunk exchange and so on and finally reach at the trunk exchange what is happening is that once again various such connections from different local exchanges are coming and converging to the same trunk exchange when this trunk exchange is communicating with another big trunk exchange  what is happening is that there are a lot of tributaries flowing into it  there are a lot of channels so basically in the same signal  we are doing time division multiplexing that means the rate at which the receiver at this end is sending  that same rate has to be maintained throughout ; but then instead of flowing in small tributaries  it is moved into a very fat channel we require a multiplexing hierarchy so such multiplexing hierarchies are easy to implement using time division multiplexing ; we will see more of this when we talk about synchronous digital hierarchy later on  refer slide time  48  21  50  47  stdm ? s advantages  we are only talking about advantages we will talk about disadvantages later on in statistical time division multiplexing  this has certainly more efficient bandwidth use it is much more efficient because as i mentioned  that specially data usage and usage in general may be very bursty and if it is bursty  then during the quiescent period  ordinary tdm is just wasting the channel whereas stdm is making full use of it so it has more efficient bandwidth use ; that is a good thing about stdm another advantage of stdm is that the frame can contain control information ; since you are putting a frame  may be with the address of the receiver or may be other kinds of control information can be put in the frame and then  the packets can be of varying sizes these are the advantages of stdm ; not all stdm systems will allow this varying sizes ; for example  atm will not allow varying size cells in atm  the packets are called cells  they will have a fixed size but some systems may allow wdm  we are writing it separately because although as i said this is some form of fdm  this works with a very high capacity  is scalable  and this has got low noise sensitivity that is another good thing about the communication in the optical domain suppose you are doing it in a electrical domain through a wire  may be  if there is some kind of electrical noise  somewhere some motor has started or very bad if there is some lightning somewhere nearby  lot of noise will get into it and this electrical wire will catch all this noise whereas an optical fiber is not going to catch any of these noises  it is very immune to noise  which is why it ? s got a very low noise sensitivity  which is very good and very high capacity and you can scale it to still higher capacity using dwdm  refer slide time  50  48  51  20  just a quick look at the disadvantages  fdm  as i mentioned earlier  is susceptible to noise  wasted bandwidth  because of this guard band  etc  and of course one frequency is whatever the small band is being permanently given to one user and if his usage is very bursty  then a lot of bandwidth is wasted then  we have a limited frequency range in tdm we have wasted bandwidth for the same reason  refer slide time  51  21  52  06  stdm takes care of that problem in a tdm but this is very expensive ; traditionally we did not have any other alternative so we used stdm a lot when high speed was necessary especially in the service provider side  we used stdm wdm is somewhat more costly than tdm and fdm but since this is a developing technology  this cost is coming down and that means the wdm cost is coming down but it is still somewhat more costly than tdm and fdm but may be less costly than stdm we have looked at the different multiplexing techniques today ; in the next lecture we will look at one kind of network  which is very widely used for data and all kinds of communication  namely  the telecom network  the telecommunication network because remember that although it is called telecommunication network and it was traditionally for people talking over telephones  for voice  etc  that is the network which carries most of the wide area data traffic today  and that is a very important we will talk about it in the next lecture preview of next lecture computers networks prof  sujoy ghosh indian institute of technology iit kharagpur lecture  6 telecom networks  refer slide time  52  52  today we will talk about telecom networks  means the kind of network that is used by telephones and of course it is by host of other things as we will discuss this telecom network is very important in the sense that first of all  it is one of the earliest network that we had and that is one thing that is quite old and secondly  the telecom network even today is mostly used for a wide area communication comparatively  we have much fewer  i mean entirely or exclusive data networks we will look at the evolution of telecom networks  refer slide time  53  54-55  29  well when alexander graham bell developed the first telephone  it was a couple of telephone instruments connected by wire now if you are trying to connect more than one people that means more than one subscribers are there ; taking this principle forward you will have to connect everybody to everybody else through a wire which of course becomes very unwieldy very soon ; because connecting or stringing a wire between every pair of telephones  that might want to communicate was not a good long term strategy at all as you can see that very soon we ? ll have veritable jungle of wires and of course its costly and it is very difficult to manage at the subscriber end you can not handle so many wires coming into your premise  so better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office there an operator could connect one telephone to another via switchboard that is the next figure  you see that the number of wires have come down as a matter of fact in the figure at the top if you have n subscribers  naturally you have n  n -1  / 2 links which is approximately n2 kind of links whereas in the latter case you have only n links so the number of links as n becomes large  and you know today there are so many telephone subscribers so there is no question of connecting them individually  you have to connect them to a central switching office  refer slide time  55  46-56  59  even then once  again i mentioned this earlier in the lecturer  you must remember that it is not that we have a whole parallel network for data from computers etc all over the globe  it is not there the telecom network has been around for a long time it had a long and very excellent history so that is why even today most of the wide area network traffic still rides on this telecom network originally it might have been a packet then it might be sort of made into some kind of a session for which there is some part of the connection is dedicated and all kinds of technology has come in but even today most of the wide area networks are based on the telecom networks and telecom  that is one side of the story  the other side of the story is that telecom networks the telecom people are actually in the process of routing some of the voice calls and may be some of the other kinds of calls into this packet kind of technology  refer slide time  57  00-57  22  so dsl at subscriber end voice traffic is transmitted as standard analog telephony signals ; data traffic is transmitted over the same line via a dsl modem that transmits the data as high frequency digital broadband signals on the same line if you have dsl modem you can have both your voice as well as data at the same time  unlike very ordinary analog lines  refer slide time  57  23-57  35  so dsl at the central office end  co end  and the signal passes through a splitter as i have shown and a local loop management system the subscriber line access multiplexer is there in this figure  refer slide time  57  36-57  39  we have already seen  refer slide time  57  40-57  43  in this figure  we have dslam and the loop management over there   refer slide time  57  44-57  59  the broadband digital signals are directed to a dslam that terminates and coordinates traffic from multiple local loop lines from the dslam  the traffic is sent to a router and then to the internet and finally we have the loop management system   refer slide time  58  02-58  24  which may be in front of the splitter  or behind the splitter this comes to various functions like giving the connections and testing and all this service kind of testing are done through the local loop management thank you
