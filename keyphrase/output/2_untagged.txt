computer networks prof  sujoy ghosh lecture # 2 network topology  refer slide time  00  53  good day in this lecture we will discuss the network topology what do you mean by a network topology ?  slide reference time  01  04  01  14   refer slide time  01  15  02  33  we can just have a quick recap of what we have learnt last time basically a computer network could be a number of nodes  which are connected by some communication links there is some kind of what we usually call a graph representing the network this graph has a certain structure we talk about the structure this structure has an implication about how will we communicate i said it is in general not feasible to have one-to-one communication between each pair of node that is not possible at all so  we need a structure formed by the nodes connected in some manner that is the subject matter of discussion today so a network may be represented as a graph nodes may represent computer or network devices like switches  routers  etc and the links represent communication links modes of communication may be broadcast or point to point  refer slide time  02  34  02  49  first let us talk about the lan topologies lan is the local area network and local area network topologies are  star  ring and bus we will just look at all of them  refer slide time  02  59  04  30  we first take up this bus topology as this is a very simple kind of network this is based on a shared broadcast link we want to have point-to-point communication there may be so many nodes a  b  c  d etc  which are connected to the network a wants to communicate to b ; a specifically wants to communicate to b so each pair of communicating nodes uses the link for the short time so a uses the link for the short time to send his message to b after that is over may be c might send something to d or something like that so other nodes ignore the communication since this is shared broadcast link  all the links are shared by all the nodes for the communication hence that is not private in that sense so all the nodes get that communication but they usually ignore this communication whereas b will copy this for its own purpose there has to be a distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link ; otherwise  communications will collide in that shared broadcast medium the communication of both the pairs of node will get garbled but we want a  b and c  d to get clear signal so there has to be some distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link  refer slide time  05  12  05  59  now let us see bus topology what do we require ? the simplest thing is a single cable a single cable connects all the computers it is as if the computers are hanging from the single cable each computer is connected to this shared cable so computers must synchronize and allow only one computer to transmit at a time as per a protocol but as such  the network is very simple network with a single copper cable  refer slide time  06  00  06  26  so this is the picture of a bus we have this shared cable and computers are somehow connected to this so a will communicate to b b will simply broadcast over this medium b will capture it c  d  e  etc will all ignore this  refer slide time  06  27  08  25  the network is maintained by the single cable cable segment must end with a terminator otherwise  what will happen is that when some node  let us say a sends a signal on the cable not only c  d  etc will get it but it will get reflected from that other end if it is not properly terminated so it becomes a kind of unwanted noise in the medium which we do not want so the coaxial cable is used there are two types of coaxial cables traditionally used one is a thin coaxial cable called thin lan and the thick coaxial cable called thick lan and extra stations can be added in a daisy chain manner this technology is sort of getting outdated at the moment you still have maybe some thin and thick lans here and there but mostly people are moving out of this and the main reason why the people are moving out of this is because this connection is likely to become loose and as soon as you have a loose connection you will have a problem in communication there are some other reasons also why this technology has become obsolete these days but still if you have shared medium  i mean the technology of using a single cable with a single broadcast medium and some machines are sharing so this something like a bus topology  refer slide time  08  26  10  23  the standard which is used on this bus topology is ieee 802.3 actually what we do is to eliminate that cable and replace with something else we will discuss that later thin ethernet is the name of the technology when we use thin coaxial cable ? we call it 10base2 in this 10 stands for that it has a 10 mbps speed whereas 2 stands for the maximum range of segment length of 200 meters the maximum number of connections is about 30 devices four repeaters may be used to a total cable length of 1000 meters if you want to have a very long cable  what will happen is that  as the signal travels down the line  the signal will get weak and as the signal gets weak you have to regenerate the signal and one way to regenerate the signal is to use a repeater over there the repeater will simply take the incoming weak signal  amplify it and send the stronger signal down the line the maximum number of nodes that you can handle here is about 150  refer slide time  10  24  11  03  thick ethernet  which is the other version where you use a thick coaxial cable called 10base5  also has the same speed of 10 megabits per second but length up to 500 meters so they were used for backbones that are limited to 500 meters with a maximum of 100 nodes per segment that is somewhat more than a thin net and a total of four repeaters of 2500 meters that is also somewhat more than thin net  refer slide time  11  05  12  42  now the bus topology has both advantages and disadvantages it is very inexpensive as you have a simple cable it is easy to add stations you can have another punch on this cable and add new station that means a new computer the amount of cable it uses is also much less and may be  it works well for very small networks it is of course no longer recommended which means you will not get these parts any longer it is getting out of fashion because it is unreliable this is much less reliable than the technology that we have today the other disadvantage is that the limited number of devices that can be attached it is difficult to isolate the problems if there is a problem  then the whole network is down sharing the same cable slows the response rates  refer slide time  12  43  13  30  now we come to direct point-to-point communication that means this is not shared so this is some kind of a dedicated point-to-point communication so computers are connected by communication channels that each connect exactly two computers they are dedicated for this pair so this forms either a mesh or a point-to-point communication  and thus a complete graph we will come to that later this is some point-to-point network that means there is a dedicated link between some pairs of nodes it allows flexibility in communication  hardware  and packet formats and also provides security and privacy because communication channels are not shared  refer slide time  13  52  14  25  with point-to-point network  the network will look somewhat like this we have these two nodes or three nodes may be connected like this if we have four nodes and we want to interconnect everybody then we require six such cables as the number of nodes goes to n the number of cables you require is going to be nc2 which is n  n ? 1  /2 which is approximately equal to n2 which means the number of cables and the total length of cables that is involved are really increasing but the kind of cable which is usually used is not as expensive as the previous thin lan or the thick lan at the same time the amount of cable that you require becomes very high hence this kind of structure is not really recommended for a local area network suppose you have  say  10 nodes in a network and you are connecting everything to everything that means every node to every other node and length of the cable for some reason  let us say  is not an issue but then each node will be connected to 9 other nodes this means that in this particular computer you will require 9 ports to which these cables will be connected but that is not so easy to provide and this is another reason why  in a local area network  this kind of mesh topology is not recommended we have an alternative for that  refer slide time  15  55  16  02  we are coming to that alternative another reason why you can not connect everybody to everybody else can be illustrated thus  suppose there are two different buildings now the length of the cable will really become enormous because if you have n cables on one side and m cables  n nodes on one side and m nodes on the other side  you have a total of m ? n number of cables which are running between two different buildings it is lot of cables really so if we want to reduce the number of communication channels we have to  refer slide time  16  34  17  18  basically give up the idea of communicating directly in a lan it means that necessarily we share the connections among many computers there are ways of doing this by multiplexing here the computer takes turns in a very orderly fashion that is called time division multiplexing and it also must include some technique for synchronizing the use that means whoever wants to use that shared channel has to wait for his turn  refer slide time  16  34-17.18  we now come to this other topology  which is very common these days it is star topology a star topology looks like this there is a central hub  the centre of the wheel is called a hub  and a number of nodes are connected to this hub i may at this stage mention that there is a physical topology and a logical topology this is a star topology because it looks like a star its physical topology is that it looks like a star sometimes the hub is made in such a way that still this is a shared medium what is the advantage of converting to what was previously a bus ? it has some practical utility in the sense that  although the length of the cable is more in this case  the cable is a different kind of cable the cable connections are much better they do not get disconnected very often furthermore when you bring all the connections together centrally  you can handle the connections at one central point whereas  if you have a long running cable  it will be difficult to locate loose connections we will have to find out failures by going around so that becomes a bit difficult so the physical star topology still maintains a logical bus topology  which is an important thing otherwise this hub or the central node may not be a shared medium at all this is often the case these days  refer slide time  19  49  20  49  of course the previous star diagram is idealized usually you will have something like this you have this hub somewhere and then you have these different computers connected and there is a number which is written over here  rj-45 connector which is the kind of connection which has become almost ubiquitous these cables are something like the kind of cables which connect your telephones they are called utp cables or unshielded twisted pair cables they are basically easier to handle and are also cheaper these connections go on to the rj-45 connectors on both sides they are much more reliable than the previous thin lan or thick lan but the physical diagram may look something like this  refer slide time  20  50  21  36  you can have an extended star topology  which means different stars may be there  which are connected in some manner that means the hubs in those stars are connected and those hubs may be shared but may not be shared medium at all they may be what are known as switches these switches are connected if you look at this diagram  you have these different switches and from each switch we have a star connection to the different computers and the switches are connected in some fashion you can call this also as a star this is called extended star topology  refer slide time  20  50-21  36  you may have a hybrid topology some part of the network may be on a shared medium some part  maybe  is not shared and even in some part  you could also have a coaxial cable running  leaving a thin lan or thick lan although that is becoming less common these days  refer slide time  22  04  23  03  now we come to another topology  which is also very important topology  called as ring topology in ring topology  computers are connected in a closed loop this has a lot of advantage the way it works is that the first node passes the data to the second node ; the second one passes the data to the third and so on the data will go on hopping around the ring and what will happen is that  as it reaches the destination  if it will go around in a loop  it will surely reach the destination at some point of time the destination will copy the same in practice there is a short connected cable from the computer to the ring ring connections may run past offices with connector cables to sockets in the offices  refer slide time  23  04  25  45  this is an example of a ring topology actually  there are two rings in a ring the data will always go in only one direction if your destination is on the wrong side then the data has to come over the whole loop and then reach the destination so there is one ring for that what is the other ring for ? we put two rings or sometimes may be even three or four  two is quite common   one important reason for putting two rings is that if there is a failure in the network there is a possibility of the communication still going on look at the picture b let us say one particular node has come down that means  there is some problem in this thing if these nodes can sense that this has really gone down  they will sort of wrap the ring around now physically this still looks like a broken ring but if you look at it as a single ring  this is still a ring going through the nodes these nodes can still communicate although there is a breakage over here either this node may break or this link may fail so many things may happen so this fault tolerance is one good reason for using rings especially in the wide area network  we have a lot of things for example  let us say  these telephone exchanges are connected in some fashion using fiber optics cable we will be talking about all those things later on but they usually put them on a ring because if the cable is cut at some place they can still communicate by using the trick that i have just shown  refer slide time  25  46  28  24  this is the summary of the characteristics of the ring topology there is no beginning or end it is actually a ring all devices have equal access to media one good thing about it is that all of them should get data at some particular point of time so they have equal access to this media in a single ring  data travels in one direction only a double ring allows fault tolerance each device has to wait its turn to transmit that means you can not start transmitting as soon as you want to transmit you have to take your turn ; and most common type is the token ring token ring has got its ieee standard number  ieee 802.5   in a token ring what happens is that the token contains the data it reaches the destination data is extracted  acknowledgement of receipt sent back to transmitting device  removed  empty token passed for another device to use that is one way a ring can be used for example  you make a data packet with this token as well as whatever you want to send to the final user so this whole packet will go over to the next node in the ring this way  it keeps hopping from one node to another till the destination when the destination gets this packet  it knows that the destination had this or some kind of identification which will be there somehow in this whole bunch of data the destination node will know that this is meant for it it will extract the data it may be put in an acknowledgement if you are using the protocol which uses acknowledgement and send it along the ring it will go around the ring and come back to the original sender and the sender will know that this data has been received that will remove this acknowledgement also and the empty token is passed and this token keeps on circulating in the ring whoever wants to transmit has to wait till it gets the token .as soon as it gets the empty token it will put in the data that it wants to send and send it along in the same way  refer slide time  28  25  30  07  ring topology has its advantages and disadvantages the advantages are that  data packets travel at great speed now one reason why data packets can travel at great speed is that this is a very synchronous operation if you remember that in a shared medium where the nodes are not synchronizing their actions  what might happen is that two different nodes may start transmitting at the same time and then their data will collide in the broadcast medium  hence killing both the communications here such a thing can not happen because it has all been synchronized with the help of the token there are others ways of synchronization we will come to all that later on data packets can travel at great speeds there are no collisions it is easier to find faults and rectify faults and terminators are not required as in an ordinary cable the disadvantages are  it requires more cable than a bus and a couple of breakdowns may bring the entire ring down smaller rings exist nowadays but anyway they are not very common this is not as common as the bus so far as the local area network is concerned in a wide area network a ring is very common as a matter of fact the ring is the most common topology that wide area network could use  refer slide time  30  08  31  00  many lan technologies that use ring topology use token passing for synchronized access to the ring the ring itself is treated as a single shared communication medium bits pass from transmitter past other computers  and are copied by destination hardware should be designed to pass token even if attached computer is out of commission this is a small technicality if the interface of the computer to the ring can function independently of the computer  that will be nice  because even if the computer is shut down  other people ? s communications are not affected  refer slide time  31  01  31  38  this is a picture of the token ring  in which the sender holding token transmits bits of frames computer not holding the token passes the bits as they go around  circulate at a very high speed the destination passes the bits but it makes a copy and the sender receives the bits of a frame and it goes out this is one way the network could work  refer slide time  31  39  31  53  when a computer wants to transmit  it waits for the token after transmission computer transmits token on the ring to the next computer ready to transmit it receives token and then transmits this token ring was originally part of a lan technology  refer slide time  31  54  34  22  but then it fell into disuse first of all the token ring devices were less common they were more costly hence the token ring as a dominant lan technology went out with time but one version of it called fddi lived on and that lived on due to the very specific advantage that the ring topology has which is fault tolerance this technology is called fddi in a fddi  the ring is made of fiber optic cables multi mode fibers or even single mode fibers can be used they use fiber optic cables in which we can send data at a fairly high speed but the speed available is not comparable to the level possible nowadays fddi technology is also not that new it is aging and that way its speed may sound less today but when it was proposed it was taken as a very high speed the basic reason why somebody still would like to use fddi is its inherent fault tolerance capability that is the technology  which is used in lan  and it is fault tolerant ring technology  which is fault tolerant  is extensively used some other technology is extensively used in wan but in the lan we have this fddi technology whose full form is fiber distributed data interconnect this is another about ring technology which uses fiber optic between stations  which transmits data at 100 mbps when we were talking about the thin lan and the thick lan we were talking about 10 mbps speed ? 100 mbps was an order of magnitude high when it was proposed it uses pairs of fibers to form two concentric rings in order to get the fault tolerance we require with two fibers or two rings  refer slide time  34  23  35  48  as soon as a fault occurs somewhere  the fddi will automatically switch off and communication will not get disturbed furthermore you can have hybrid topology in the sense that you can have a ring  which emanates from the various nodes of the rings stars will form ; they will be the different hubs of the different stars and these different hubs can be put in a ring as a matter of fact  this is the very common way how fddi is configured some fddi switches form a ring and from each of these fddi switches  we can start other kind of technologies like ethernet etc  which form a tree-like structure the other reason why you could have hybrid topology is that older networks are updated and replaced  leaving some older segments you have replaced one part of network ; you will get a hybrid kind of topology thus it combines two or different more different types of topologies the common one is star bus or star ring star ring uses an mau  multi-station access unit   which is basically a part of fddi  refer slide time  35  54  38  48  next we take up the study of mesh topology by a mesh or a full mesh  it is meant a complete graph as shown here as discussed earlier  a complete mesh would take a lot of cable but at the same time with complete mesh we have lot of alternative paths from any node to any other node the diagram shows eight nodes and each one of them is connected to every other node now between any two nodes  you will have direct path and indirect paths as well we have many paths for going from the same source to the same destination this means that when one of the links breaks  all of them can still communicate without any problem as this arrangement takes lot of cables  we do not use this what we use is a partial mesh in a partial mesh some of these links would be dropped  taking care that none of the nodes becomes disconnected but all the links of the mesh need not be there even in the partial mesh we can still have some form of redundancy and thus have some level of fault tolerance but it may be not as much as one available in a full mesh for such a partial mesh the network topology is not well specified and it is difficult to evolve a protocol like token passing protocol so here you have to have some other method of sensing the faults and correcting them that becomes more complicated but the partial mesh topology is used in many places  refer slide time  38  49  39  55  mesh topology of course is not common on lans these are most often used in wans to interconnect lans because wan links usually are costly the users of a wan link naturally expect a certain grade of service that is why the wan service providers usually keep alternative paths if one of the paths becomes unavailable due to some node failure or due to some link failure then it can still send the traffic across the wan through some alternative paths  refer slide time  39  56  40  35  so the pros and cons of mesh topology are like this the advantage is of course it improves fault tolerance and it can carry more data the disadvantages of course are increased cost installation  difficulty in management and troubleshooting  slide reference time  40  41  41  20  now we have seen that each of these topologies has advantages as well as disadvantages rings ease synchronization  but it may be disabled if a cable breaks star is easier to manage and more robust but it requires more cable bus requires fewer cables  may be disabled if cable breaks and is not so reliable bus would not have fault tolerance really so as far as the lan is concerned  people are gravitating towards star topology that means some nodes or some computers may be connected to a switch and then some other computers may be connected to some other switch and then these switches will get connected in some fashion extended star topology is the most common topology as this is emerging in local area networks in wide area networks we have both ring as well as mesh topologies  refer slide time  41  21-46  12  the physical and the logical topologies may be different something will look like a physical star but it may actually be a ring let us look at the following examples suppose you have this as the hub of the star and we have these three stations a  b  and c ; we have say cable ducts running over there like this  through which a number of cables are passing at the central hub you might connect two cables like this and then more pairs of cables in a similar manner because this is one central place you can do this what you essentially have is a ring what you essentially have is a ring similarly  you can have any other kind of topology suppose you have a number of cables coming in like this now if we have a connection like this and similarly in all other places  then you can actually have a mesh although all this is within one physical duct and another physical duct going to nodes a  b  c  and d  it looks very much like a physical star but the actual connection is something like a mesh just as i could make a star  i could make it a mesh also the media is the physical topology whereas the way in which data access the medium and transmits packets is the logical topology a lan at a network is not always revealing cables emerging from a hub do not make it necessarily a star topology it may actually be a bus or a ring in a star topology  there is some piece of network box  which is called a hub this hub actually replaces the single cable this is again a shared medium if they are connected like a star it has got the star connection people use hubs these days but they do not use the single cable like thin lan and thick lan though it looks like a star  depending upon what kind of box it is  it could be actually a bus similarly as i have shown you  it could be a ring also  refer slide time  46  14  47  27  now the choice of logical topology is going to affect the physical topology and of course the other way around the kind of physical topology you will have will also dictate the kind of logical topology that you can have the kind of logical topology you can have will depend on two things ? one the actual physical topology  the number of cables you have etc  another is the type of network boxes like switches  hubs or whatever you have as the nodes we have to design carefully because it may be difficult to change the part way through the installation when you think about designing a network  you have to put the physical topology min place to get the correct logical topology your choice will determine cable installation network  network connections and protocols and spots where you will drill holes in the building  refer slide time  47  33  50  48  the different factors which you take into account while deciding on a particular topology are  the first thing that comes is what kind of technology you are going to use ? there are different kinds of lan technologies ? for example  if you are using fddi  then you have to have a logical ring somewhere if you are using the ethernet  you may have an extended star topology the kind of technology you are using is a factor and of course this technology will have some cost benefit as a matter of fact  in a lan  you will find that apart from the network boxes  in greenfield kind of situation   the cost of the cable is also significant then there is a question of scalability often what people will do is that  they will work with one kind of network and then  very soon  the network will get choked or people will want more bandwidth or more users will join this keeps on happening a network is never a stable thing in any organization ; but whenever you are putting some kind of topology or some kind of technology you have to think that 3 years to 5 years down the line  you will have to scale the network up you may have to change the number of your network boxes ; some of the boxes for example in old technology you may have had a bus by putting in a hub it was a physical star  but it is a bus now you put a switch over there and make it a star topology kind of thing and then later on people want more bandwidth when more people want to join  you have to design your physical topology that way for scalability  the bandwidth capacity and the ease of installation because how you take the cables around and how you scale up down and how you can install it are always problems ease of finding fault is another important factor we will talk more about it in the next class it is good to have a central cabling plan where all cables are coming you can manage all your cables in one central place .there are standards like structured cabling which are used for easy fault finding and maintenance thank you ! preview of next lecture good day ! today we will be talking about multiplexing  refer slide time  51  15  51  18   refer slide time  51  25  51  32  multiplexing is about sharing a medium different users share the same medium for communication at the same time  refer slide time  51  40  52  00  a medium can normally carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signals will get garbled .for multiple signals to share one medium  the medium must somehow be divided to give each signal a portion of total bandwidth a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource as far as communication is concerned we try to use this bandwidth somehow to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers.that is the idea of multiplexing there are various reasons why we want to use multiplexing and the chief one is that of transmission services which are  refer slide time  52  43  53  35  very expensive  in leased lines packet switched networks  for example  laying of line in itself fairly expensive and complex proposition and once you lay a line you really like to utilize it to the maximum the other thing is that  if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication multiplexing and compression techniques save a lot of money for the business when you can send a lot of data through the same line the data capacity of the line increases it becomes more cost effective for the company .most data devices individually require modest amount of data but with a number of users their aggregated requirements may occupy quite a substantial bandwidth  refer slide time  53  52  54  03  the current technique to accomplish this include frequency division multiplexing  wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing  refer slide time  54  04  54  49  in the scheme of multiplexing  you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side .so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link .on the other side  depending on how you have put them together  they are separated into different lines these different lines can now go to different recipients on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here a number of sender receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in between  refer slide time  54  50  55  32  the alternative to multiplexing should be direct point to point connection this has number of problems .first problem is that you need those lines that we need for each device you thus need a large amount of wiring if they are on different floors  you need large number of io ports on the computer side  which really is not feasible you may have a few io ports  but you can not have hundreds of io ports it is really difficult to have hundreds of io ports .that is also another bottleneck   refer slide time  55  33  55  54  in a somewhat older approach  multi drop line   the host polls machine to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines total communications load is not greater than the rate of line  refer slide time  55  55  56  15  using a multiplexer approach all the device data ? s are multiplexed on one side  sent through one a line out link carries multiple channels of information  refer slide time  56  16  56  20  the signal will be restored depending on the quantum of noise present .if the noise is high then we will lose some information there will be some distortion and some loss of information would be there in case of digital signals it is more fault tolerant and more resilient compared to analog signals  refer slide time  57  01  57  17  we can correct errors in transmission using digital signals we add few bytes of error checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected i will give you a simple example  suppose we are sending groups of eight bits called byte now what can we do is that associated with each byte we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make the number of ones in whole nine bits to be odd  this is an example of odd parity now if at the receiver end we find that the number of ones have become even we know that  some bits must have flipped that means some bits must instead of zero have got a one and instead of one we got a zero it must have happened otherwise because the number of bits are supposed to be odd and of course by adding one bit we can always dictate that the number of bits in the original that means the sending station was odd .in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit the whole bunch once again hopefully there will not be error next time this is of course a very primitive kind of error checking there are more sophisticated error checking methods employed in networks and communications  refer slide time  58  40  58  48
