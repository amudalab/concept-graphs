operations of insertion
insertion deletion search
bad as order
tree which doesn
bad a height
data structure call
structure call avl
call avl trees
avl tree avl
tree avl tress
height balanced trees
ignore this white
inside the nodes
root is left
call the height
define this turn
sub tree rooted
set of descendents
define the height
single turn node
tree has height
two so level
height this sub
node i put
put down height
trees called avl
height balanced means
height this node
difference the left
left sub tree
right sub tree
tree the left
tree the heights
children it doesn
make any incidence
incidence to call
call to talk
node the right
sis the left
tree is missing
missing we call
made this change
today right absence
shift the definition
put some keys
node height balanced
leaf node write
height balanced properties
balanced properties violated
kind of trees
trees as avl
good so lets
lets trying figure
avl trees lets
out how bad
bad the height
prove in lets
minutes the height
prove this claim
make a small
slightly different argument
tree of height
number of nodes
nodes so define
define the quantities
trees of height
lets us figure
implies this proportion
tree of heritage
recall a binary
nodes of height
complete binary tree
single ten node
height two rooted
rooted one node
rooted two children
counting minimum right
end two equals
two the minimum
two so suppose
suppose avl tree
height h minus
children its children
minus one right
trees has height
tree have height
two why minimum
minus two height
lets of height
minus one sub
minus two sub
two sub tree
close form expression
solve this recurrence
solving this recurrence
minus two right
grows the number
atleast as largest
largest two times
two strictly large
thing to solve
implies this entire
four which implies
suppose i pick
pick i equals
minus one times
two times log
tree whose height
satisfy this relation
satisfy the relation
minimum possible number
nodes and height
nodes has height
login two login
argued after taking
implies h equals
big o log
number of number
nodes the height
height only log
tree very dense
great so lets
recurrence is solved
fairly crude analysis
right we replace
root two right
atleast as larger
case h equals
equals one pay
true this statement
statement is true
made a mistake
back this base
redefine the height
suppose the claim
claim is true
strictly larger right
quantity is larger
two is lager
right okay good
cancel out terms
minus c minus
multiply both side
satisfy this right
solve this quadratic
right one minus
wont as large
roughly one point
good okay good
fibonacci number minus
minus one good
thing to pick
right so induction
make a difference
make that correction
make any difference
greater than equal
quadratic in equality
power k minus
make that small
height now log
base one point
tree with smallest
smallest possible number
equals h minus
definition of log
prove this kind
satisfy n equals
equals two right
agreed okay great
ways of solving
make a guess
right so earlier
two one point
bit more detail
leaf that leaf
root which means
suppose this leaf
two k minus
requires the proof
proof and lets
important the number
root right suppose
class for avl
avl tree lets
work with level
starting one doesn
make a big
big difference lets
start with level
draw this picture
color it red
sub tree hanging
level zero level
level k minus
child this child
child has height
node this sub
root have height
property of avl
arbitrary binary tree
understand that right
leaf at level
band whose width
largest possible height
height the tree
make another claim
nodes at level
first k minus
minus two levels
contradict so lets
node at level
node u level
shown know node
argument would applied
children no right
child so sub
height balance property
property is violated
children at level
right everyone understands
provided this guide
problem height balance
children okay great
full full means
means the tree
minus one node
argued we recall
recall that height
minus one nodes
implies the number
height right lets
right lets substitute
minus one lets
thing square root
proved the sharper
bound the point
logarithmic height property
solving the recurrence
method we solving
relation the shop
shop is long
tree is concerned
suppose i give
root its atleast
half the height
require a proof
first h minus
levels the avl
binary tree lets
levels its complete
complete very dense
turn the tree
initially its dense
kind of things
part the fact
two levels means
lot of nodes
tree is atleast
two h nodes
mind about avl
nice the height
search in certainty
certainty in log
search is easy
problem with search
tree right forget
forget the height
order it height
height is log
insert right suppose
wrong so recall
call this height
balanced that treat
insert a node
change the height
consequence the height
height balanced property
insert so insert
step of insertion
first you find
find the position
find that element
put the node
node there put
updating the heights
nodes you encountered
nodes whose heights
nodes whose height
doing an insertion
place where height
height change appears
appears where height
inserted and move
parent parent parent
hit the route
follow we find
find the first
height imbalance property
suppose that node
skip this part
part and wise
wise up node
show your picture
idea so suppose
forget this empty
avl tree height
tree height balance
balance is satisfied
forget this type
type of node
lets say fifty
right here left
balance property violated
height balance properties
properties we call
call this nodes
nodes its child
tree to make
height balanced tree
leave the tree
kind of rotation
kind of move
class right understand
operation is done
change the keys
draw the picture
out what rotation
property is retained
insertion and deletion
class we looked
looked at avl
trees are defined
proved a bound
bound of log
right we spend
spend a lot
solve that recurrence
