day so today
talking about switches
types of switches
kind of switches
talking about packet
heart of data
networks first thing
order n2 kind
kind of lines
user is connected
essentially a switch
switching office switches
office switches establish
switches establish temporary
establish temporary circuits
means they establish
establish a temporary
switching station switching
station switching systems
discussion about telecom
station the switching
making this connection
kind of computers
capable of sending
sending some kind
kind of signals
signals or instructions
switch for setting
plane is sort
connection is set
naturally the call
close to switching
decide about long-range
seven-layer osi protocols
layer whose job
order to reach
reach the ultimate
ultimate destination station
strictly a local
coming from input
routers to reach
reach my destination
switch the job
signal is coming
required routing static
routing static routing
means same destination
destination is routed
depending on traffic
means some part
avoid that path
distribute the telephone
numbers to subscribers
easy to route
connectivity between input
input and output
discuss some basic
concepts and terminology
medium ? transfer
send a stream
stream of cells
queues are memory
temporarily store cells
store cells switches
switches often require
require some queues
side ; queues
temporary memory locations
store some cells
destination a switching
switch a switch
point a switch
switch may connect
elements these switching
switching elements form
form the so-called
means the shape
switches are organized
term called blocking
blocking and non-blocking
means a network
network is unable
unable to connect
calls the point
thousands of subscribers
provide the switching
maximum possible extent
provision our equipment
people have done
made an extensive
labs in usa
giant telephone company
study about people
habits they found
officers are open
kind of statistic

capacity this kind
kind of blocking
blocking may occur
capacity to handle
calculate the blocking
permits all stations
stations to connect
connect in pairs
connection where blocking
allowed or blocking
amount of blocking

kinds of switches
switches neatly fit
hybrid or mixture
space division switching

memory or shared
talk about space
separate physical paths
unlike time division
discuss time division
paths the simplest
simplest of space
cross bar switch
switch the number

cross points grows
square of number
number of stations
stations ; loss
loss of cross
cross point prevents
point prevents connection
point becomes bad
stations are connected
switch a cross
input lines coming
fourth input line
direct physical path
single switching element
n cross points
switches one good
kind of switch
pairs of subscribers
subscribers can talk
lines that feed
feed to n2electronic
lines are full
means all lines
lines allow communication
half the number
number of switches
require the diagonal
switches ? top
top half means
half means top
means top half
switches are required
full duplex lines
cross bar switches
problem ? people
design for switches
at&t bell labs
essentially we require
require using output
issues in detail
number of bits
line can handle
speed transfer medium
transfer medium consists
inlet n bus
bus interface units
buses each delivers
delivers an output
side a call
call to subscriber
broadcast the signal
units are connected
receive that signal
bus interface unit
supposed be meant
signal to transfer
fairly simple scheme
reduced the number
number of switching
switches and multistage
commonly used switching
architecture even today
division is concerned
concerned in multistage

log-k n number
number of stages
bigger delta network
order to code
require four bits
regular cross bar
require some thing
problem of contention
delta network cells
network however cells
similarly another line
two different points
sort of converging
make it wait
wait by putting
blocked or dropped
contention some ways
ways to reduce
basic switching element
increase the internal
internal link speed
link speed relative
sort of techniques
techniques to reduce
speed that means
streams are concerned
notice the faster
contention then give
sort of re-circulates
networks in parallel
parallel ; provide
provide multiple links
internally between switching
batcher banyan switch
banyan switch part
collide by contending
space division switch
switch is broken
broken into multistage
multistage smaller chunks
show a three-stage
three-stage switch suppose
switch ; suppose
reduces the number
