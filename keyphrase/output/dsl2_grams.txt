talk about abstract
abstract data types
stacks are implemented
implemented in java
java and application
talk about growable
bit of amortized
talk about stacks
stacks in java
java virtual machine
abstract data type
basically a specification
set of axioms
axioms that define
define the semantics
types like integer
understand the notion
notion of addition
integers in mathematics
define data types
types those operations
parameters that operation
case of integers
integers as defined
defined in mathematics
add a variable
variable of type
method in java
create an instance
talking about sophisticated
sophisticated data types
lot of work
work access functions
type and manipulation
manipulate or modify
modify the data
talking about data
data types data
types data types
identify the requirements
level of abstraction
talking in terms
terms of adding
terms of stacks
stacks or queues
advanced data type
type they encapsulate
encapsulate the data
data is organized
algorithms that work
separate the issues
issues of correctness
correctness and efficiency
start by giving
giving a simple
set a set
set is defined
collection of objects
modify that collection
add or remove
remove an object
changing the set
create data types
kinds of methods
method to create
create a dynamic
insert an element
element the result
includes the element
similarly the delete
delete method removes
removes the element
methods for updating
updating the set
set new method
creating or constructing
constructing the set
set and isin
true otherwise false
operations should behave
set is empty
define the nature
code for implementing
implementing the dynamic
talking about abstract
axioms that govern
govern those operations
simple abstract data
collection of elements
remove an element
last the operation
operation of inserting
inserting an element
operation of removing
removing an element
kind of toys
elements for instance
stack of trays
put a tray
remove or pop
define the abstract
create a stack
adds this element
type it inserts
inserts an object
pop takes stack
pop the stack
removes the top
stack is empty
flag an error
empty the top
top operation returns
returns the top
pop pop operation
pop operation removes
removes that element
empty then top
make any sense
method size tells
stack and isempty
size and isempty
methods and hope
methods are doing
governs the behavior
push an element
doing a top
stack abstract data
translate abstract data
type into code
interfaces and exceptions
interface an interface
methods are done
names of parameter
write a class
provide the code
write the classes
interface different people
people will write
write different classes
classes to implement
implement the interface
completely different ways
meet the interface
meets the specification
program it helps
separate the implementation
built-in stack data
stack data structure
define a stack
method called size
methods are implemented
takes a parameter
parameter of type
type object object
type in java
objects are derived
type the method
method isempty returns
isempty returns boolean
returns an object
object it throws
notion of exceptions
exceptions void means
return any object
return a stack
modifies the stack
stack thus stack
mechanisms to handle
reach some exceptional
execution of program
throw an exception
exception the term
java is throw
exception is thrown
flow of control
occurs you delegate
delegate the responsibility
responsibility of handling
handling that exceptional
eat pizza method
method which throws
throws a stomachache
stomachacheexception the procedure
procedure public void
public void eatpizza
inside the stimulate
stimulate meeting procedure
stomachacheexception is thrown
exist this method
executed the flow
control would interrupt
interrupt the dotted
modified it depends
modifications are carried
enclose the method
open a bracket
include the method
calling and close
raised in ta.eatpizza
skip the catch
exception was raised
method might raise
raise many exceptions
block and execute
execute the statements
raises an exception
exception is caught
inside the catch
block any kind
kind of statements
write the catch
block this procedure
procedure simulate meeting
throw the exception
throws an exception
catches the exception
high level procedure
finally your procedure
procedure will stop
exception is shown
method to print
print the statement
statement an exception
creating an object
initializing that instance
set of parameters
object by making
making a call
statement is caught
created by stomachacheexception
procedural hierarchy stomachacheexception
stomachacheexception would throw
procedure of simulate
meeting would throw
reaches the console
written would signify
signify in java
java it signifies
invoking the constructor
method with ouch
method for listening
exceptions and catching
exception in turn
add a throws
wrote the method
stomachacheexception a method
method can throw
exception in java
class public class
public class stomachacheexception
class stomachacheexception extends
class name public
constructor method takes
takes a single
string super means
calling the super
catch an exception
chain of method
stomach ache exception
exception is extending
extending a run
run time exception
call the constructor
created the interface
implement the methods
ways of implementing
implementing a stack
stack the variable
push another element
out an entire
interface my implementation
array to implement
implement the stack
stack the statement

stack interface public
