member ? first
distributed and dynamic
system so things
router is concerned
pruning is sending
sending a prune

prune has retired
send a prune
prune message stating
send anymore packets
send the prune
naturally it drops
drops this packet
local member sends
sends a prune

non rpf interfaces
source to distant
longer a member
back a prune
destination that prunes
prunes this link
message temporarily disables
disables a routing
removes a link

reactivate a pruned
pruned routing table
reactivate this link
sending a graft
graft message disables

prune and reactivates
reactivates the routing
pruning and grafting
grafting are complimentary
prune to disable
graft to enable

provided the downstream
dvmrp has limitations
distance vector protocols
affected by count-to-infinity
count-to-infinity and transient

round and round
counting of potential
vector routing transient
routing transient looping
transient looping means

packet goes round
vulnerable than unicast
shares the scaling
flat routing domain
advantages of ospf
ospf over rip
ospf we break
regions or autonomous
routing problem remains
problem remains simpler
scale to bigger
networks since dvmrp
dvmrp is based
based on rip
ideas of rip
problem in dvmrp
state in routers
flooding the network
network grows bigger
broadcast becomes unacceptable
problem in scaling
senders many small
groups also undesired
forms a source-based
number of groups
problem of maintaining
limitation for scaling
effort to implement
essentially an overlay
routers using dvmrp
