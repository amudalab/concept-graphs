programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as c + + or java  22   23  the language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale  24  python supports multiple programming paradigms  including object-oriented  imperative and functional programming or procedural styles it features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library  25  python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems  allowing python code execution on a wide variety of systems using third-party tools  such as py2exe or pyinstaller   26  python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems  allowing for the distribution of python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a python interpreter cpython  the reference implementation of python  is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model  as do nearly all of its alternative implementations cpython is managed by the non-profit python software foundation contents  hide

creator of python main article  history of python python was conceived in the late 1980s  27  and its implementation was started in december 1989  28  by guido van rossum at cwi in the netherlands as a successor to the abc language  itself inspired by setl   29  capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system  5  van rossum is python 's principal author  and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of python is reflected in the title given to him by the python community  benevolent dictator for life  bdfl   about the origin of python  van rossum wrote in 1996   30  over six years ago  in december 1989  i was looking for a " hobby " programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around christmas my office  would be closed  but i had a home computer  and not much else on my hands i decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language i had been thinking about lately  a descendant of abc that would appeal to unix/c hackers i chose python as a working title for the project  being in a slightly irreverent mood  and a big fan of monty python 's flying circus   python 2.0 was released on 16 october 2000  and included many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for unicode with this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed  31  python 3.0  also called python 3000 or py3k   a major  backwards-incompatible release  was released on 3 december 2008  32  after a long period of testing many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible python 2.6 and 2.7  33  features and philosophy  edit  python is a multi-paradigm programming language  object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported  and there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming  including by metaprogramming  34  and by magic methods    35  many other paradigms are supported using extensions  including design by contract  36   37  and logic programming  38  python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management an important feature of python is dynamic name resolution  late binding   which binds method and variable names during program execution the design of python offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition the language has map    reduce   and filter   functions ; comprehensions for lists  dictionaries  and sets ; and generator expressions  39  the standard library has two modules  itertools and functools  that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml  40  the core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document " pep 20  the zen of python  "  which includes aphorisms such as   41  beautiful is better than ugly explicit is better than implicit simple is better than complex complex is better than complicated readability counts rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language 's core  python was designed to be highly extensible python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface this design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by van rossum from the very start because of his frustrations with abc  which espoused the opposite mindset    27  while offering choice in coding methodology  the python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax  such as in perl  in favor of a sparser  less-cluttered grammar as alex martelli put it  " to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture "  42  python 's philosophy rejects the perl " there is more than one way to do it " approach to language design in favor of " there should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it "   41  python 's developers strive to avoid premature optimization  and moreover  reject patches to non-critical parts of cpython which would offer a marginal increase in speed at the cost of clarity  43  when speed is important  python programmers use pypy  a just-in-time compiler  or move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c cython is also available which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter an important goal of the python developers is making python fun to use this is reflected in the origin of the name which comes from monty python   44  and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials  such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar  45   46  a common neologism in the python community is pythonic  which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well  that it is natural or shows fluency in the language  that it conforms with python 's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability in contrast  code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic users and admirers of python — especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced — are often referred to as pythonists  pythonistas  and pythoneers  47   48  syntax and semantics  edit  main article  python syntax and semantics python is intended to be a highly readable language it is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout  frequently using english keywords where other languages use punctuation furthermore  python has a smaller number of syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal  49  indentation  edit  main article  python syntax and semantics § indentation python uses whitespace indentation  rather than curly braces or keywords  to delimit blocks ; this feature is also termed the off-side rule an increase in indentation comes after certain statements ; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block  50  statements and control flow  edit  python 's statements include  among others   the if statement  which conditionally executes a block of code  along with else and elif  a contraction of else-if   the for statement  which iterates over an iterable object  capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block the while statement  which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true the try statement  which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses ; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits the class statement  which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class  for use in object-oriented programming the def statement  which defines a function or method the with statement  from python 2.5   which encloses a code block within a context manager  for example  acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards  or opening a file and then closing it   allowing raii-like behavior the pass statement  which serves as a nop it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block the assert statement  used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply the yield statement  which returns a value from a generator function from python 2.5  yield is also an operator this form is used to implement coroutines the import statement  which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program the print statement was changed to the print   function in python 3  51  python does not support tail-call optimization or first-class continuations  and  according to guido van rossum  it never will  52   53  however  better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5  by extending python 's generators  54  prior to 2.5  generators were lazy iterators ; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator as of python 2.5  it is possible to pass information back into a generator function  and as of python 3.3  the information can be passed through multiple stack levels  55  expressions  edit  python expressions are similar to languages such as c and java  addition  subtraction  and multiplication are the same  but the behavior of division differs  see mathematics for details   python also added the * * operator for exponentiation in python  = = compares by value  in contrast to java  where it compares by reference  value comparisons in java use the equals   method  python 's is operator may be used to compare object identities  comparison by reference   comparisons may be chained  for example a < = b < = c python uses the words and  or  not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&  | |  ! used in java and c python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression  39  anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions ; however  these are limited in that the body can only be a single expression conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y  56   different in order of operands from the  operator common to many other languages   python makes a distinction between lists and tuples lists are written as  1  2  3   are mutable  and can not be used as the keys of dictionaries  dictionary keys must be immutable in python   tuples are written as  1  2  3   are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries  provided all elements of the tuple are immutable the parentheses around the tuple are optional in some contexts tuples can appear on the left side of an equal sign ; hence a statement like x  y = y  x can be used to swap two variables python has a " string format " operator %  this functions analogous to printf format strings in c  e.g " foo = % s bar = % d " %  " blah "  2  evaluates to " foo = blah bar = 2 "  in python 3 and 2.6 +  this was supplemented by the format   method of the str class  e.g " foo =  0  bar =  1  " .format  " blah "  2   python has various kinds of string literals  strings delimited by single or double quotation marks unlike in unix shells  perl and perl-influenced languages  single quotation marks and double quotation marks function identically both kinds of string use the backslash  \  as an escape character and there is no implicit string interpolation such as " $ foo "  triple-quoted strings  which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotation marks they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells  perl and ruby raw string varieties  denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r no escape sequences are interpreted ; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common  such as regular expressions and windows-style paths compare " @ -quoting " in c #  python has index and slice expressions on lists  denoted as a  key   a  start  stop  or a  start  stop  step   indexes are zero-based  and negative indexes are relative to the end slices take elements from the start index up to  but not including  the stop index the third slice parameter  called step or stride  allows elements to be skipped and reversed slice indexes may be omitted  for example a    returns a copy of the entire list each element of a slice is a shallow copy in python  a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced  in contrast to languages such as common lisp  scheme  or ruby this leads to some duplication of functionality for example  list comprehensions vs for-loops conditional expressions vs if blocks the eval   vs exec   built-in functions  in python 2  exec is a statement  ; the former is for expressions  the latter is for statements statements can not be a part of an expression  so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions  all being expressions  can not contain statements a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 can not form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator = = in conditions  if  c = 1     is valid c code but if c = 1   causes a syntax error in python methods  edit  methods on objects are functions attached to the object 's class ; the syntax instance.method  argument  is  for normal methods and functions  syntactic sugar for class.method  instance  argument   python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data  in contrast to the implicit self  or this  in some other object-oriented programming languages  e.g c + +  java  objective-c  or ruby    57  typing  edit  python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names type constraints are not checked at compile time ; rather  operations on an object may fail  signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type despite being dynamically typed  python is strongly typed  forbidding operations that are not well-defined  for example  adding a number to a string  rather than silently attempting to make sense of them python allows programmers to define their own types using classes  which are most often used for object-oriented programming new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class  for example  spamclass   or eggsclass     and the classes themselves are instances of the metaclass type  itself an instance of itself   allowing metaprogramming and reflection prior to version 3.0  python had two kinds of classes  " old-style " and " new-style "   58  old-style classes were eliminated in python 3.0  making all classes new-style in versions between 2.2 and 3.0  both kinds of classes could be used the syntax of both styles is the same  the difference being whether the class object is inherited from  directly or indirectly  all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type

ellipsis placeholder to be used as an index in numpy arrays  mathematics  edit  python has the usual c arithmetic operators  +    *  /  %   it also has * * for exponentiation  e.g 5 * * 3 = = 125 and 9 * * .5 = = 3.0 and a new matrix multiply operator @ coming in 3.5  60  the behavior of division has changed significantly over time  61  python 2.1 and earlier use the c division behavior the / operator is integer division if both operands are integers  and floating point division otherwise integer division rounds towards 0  e.g 7 / 3 = = 2 and -7 / 3 = = -2 python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity  e.g 7 / 3 = = 2 and -7 / 3 = = -3 the floor division // operator is introduced so 7 // 3 = = 2  -7 // 3 = = -3  7.5 // 3 = = 2.0 and -7.5 // 3 = = -3.0 adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python 3.0 rules for division  see next   python 3.0 changes / to always be floating point division in python terms  the pre-3.0 / is " classic division "  the 3.0 / is " real division "  and // is " floor division "  rounding towards negative infinity  though different from most languages  adds consistency for instance  it means that the equation  a + b  // b = = a // b + 1 is always true it also means that the equation b *  a // b  + a % b = = a is valid for both positive and negative values of a however  maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a % b is  as expected  in the half-open interval  0,b   where b is a positive integer  it has to lie in the interval  b,0  when b is negative  62  python provides a round function for rounding floats to integers versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero  round  0.5  is 1.0  round  -0.5  is 1.0  63  python 3 uses round-to-even  round  1.5  is 2  round  2.5  is 2  64  the decimal type/class in module decimal  since version 2.4  provides exact numerical representation and several rounding modes python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general usage in mathematics for example  the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c c-derived languages interpret this expression differently  in c  the expression would first evaluate a < b  resulting in 0 or 1  and that result would then be compared with c  65   page needed  due to python 's extensive mathematics library  it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as data processing and manipulation libraries  edit  python has a large standard library  commonly cited as one of python 's greatest strengths   66  providing tools suited to many tasks this is deliberate and has been described as a " batteries included "  25  python philosophy for internet-facing applications  a large number of standard formats and protocols  such as mime and http  are supported modules for creating graphical user interfaces  connecting to relational databases  pseudorandom number generators  arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals   67  manipulating regular expressions  and doing unit testing are also included some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications  for example  the wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep 333  68    but the majority of the modules are not they are specified by their code  internal documentation  and test suite  if supplied   however  because most of the standard library is cross-platform python code  there are only a few modules that must be altered or completely rewritten by alternative implementations the standard library is not essential to run python or embed python within an application blender 2.49  for instance  omits most of the standard library as of january 2015  the python package index  the official repository of third-party software for python  contains more than 54,000 packages offering a wide range of functionality  including  graphical user interfaces  web frameworks  multimedia  databases  networking and communications test frameworks  automation and web scraping  documentation tools  system administration scientific computing  text processing  image processing development

enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately  repl   in short  python acts as a shell other shells add capabilities beyond those in the basic interpreter  including idle and ipython while generally following the visual style of the python shell  they implement features like auto-completion  retention of session state  and syntax highlighting in addition to standard desktop python ides  integrated development environments   there are also browser-based ides  sage  intended for developing science and math-related python programs   and a browser-based ide and hosting environment  pythonanywhere implementations  edit  see also  list of python software § python implementations the main python implementation  named cpython  is written in c meeting the c89 standard  69  it compiles python programs into intermediate bytecode   70  which is executed by the virtual machine  71  cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and python it is available in versions for many platforms  including microsoft windows and most modern unix-like systems cpython was intended from almost its very conception to be cross-platform  72  pypy is a fast  compliant  73  interpreter of python 2.7 and 3.2 its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython  74  a version taking advantage of multi-core processors using software transactional memory is being created  75  stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads ; it does not use the c memory stack  thus allowing massively concurrent programs pypy also has a stackless version  76  other just-in-time compilers have been developed in the past  but are now unsupported  google started a project called unladen swallow in 2009 with the aims of increasing the speed of the python interpreter by 5 times by using the llvm and improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores  77  psyco is a specialising just in time compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime the produced code is specialised for certain data types and is faster than standard python code in 2005  nokia released a python interpreter for the series 60 mobile phones called pys60 it includes many of the modules from the cpython implementations and some additional modules for integration with the symbian operating system this project has been kept up to date to run on all variants of the s60 platform and there are several third party modules available the nokia n900 also supports python with gtk widget libraries  with the feature that programs can be both written and run on the device itself  78  there are several compilers to high-level object languages  with either unrestricted python  a restricted subset of python  or a language similar to python as the source language  jython compiles into java byte code  which can then be executed by every java virtual machine implementation this also enables the use of java class library functions from the python program ironpython follows a similar approach in order to run python programs on the .net common language runtime the rpython language can be compiled to c  java bytecode  or common intermediate language  and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python pyjamas compiles python to javascript shed skin compiles python to c + +  cython and pyrex compile to c a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non-numerical  combinatorial  workload was presented at euroscipy '13  79  development  edit  python 's development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal  pep  process the pep process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features  for collecting community input on an issue  and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into python  80  outstanding peps are reviewed and commented upon by the python community and by van rossum  the python project 's bdfl  80  enhancement of the language goes along with development of the cpython reference implementation the mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about the language 's development ; specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org  81  development takes place on a self-hosted source code repository running mercurial  82  cpython 's public releases come in three types  distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented  backwards-incompatible versions  where code is expected to break and must be manually ported the first part of the version number is incremented these releases happen infrequently — for example  version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0 major or " feature " releases  which are largely compatible but introduce new features the second part of the version number is incremented these releases are scheduled to occur roughly every 18 months  and each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release  83  bugfix releases  which introduce no new features but fix bugs the third and final part of the version number is incremented these releases are made whenever a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release  or roughly every 3 months security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases  84  a number of alpha  beta  and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before the final release is made although there is a rough schedule for each release  this is often pushed back if the code is not ready the development team monitor the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development  and using the buildbot continuous integration system  85  the community of python developers has also contributed over 58,000 software modules  as of may 2  2015  to the python package index  called pypi   the official repository of third-party libraries for python the major academic conference on python is named pycon there are special mentoring programmes like the pyladies naming  edit  python 's name is derived from the television series monty python 's flying circus   86  and it is common to use monty python references in example code  87  for example  the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs  instead of the traditional foo and bar  87   88  as well as this  the official python documentation often contains various obscure monty python references the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame  a binding of sdl to python  commonly used to create games  ; pys60  an implementation for the symbian s60 operating system ; pyqt and pygtk  which bind qt and gtk  respectively  to python ; and pypy  a python implementation originally written in python use  edit  main article  list of python software since 2008  python has consistently ranked in the top eight most popular programming languages as measured by the tiobe programming community index  19  it is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on c  e.g c + +  c #  objective-c  java an empirical study found scripting languages  such as python  more productive than conventional languages  such as c and java  for a programming problem involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary memory consumption was often " better than java and not much worse than c or c + + "   89  large organizations that make use of python include google   90  yahoo !   91  cern   92  nasa   93  and some smaller ones like ilm   94  and ita  95  python can serve as a scripting language for web applications  e.g  via mod_wsgi for the apache web server  96  with web server gateway interface  a standard api has evolved to facilitate these applications web application frameworks like django  pylons  pyramid  turbogears  web2py  tornado  flask and zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications pyjamas and ironpython can be used to develop the client-side of ajax-based applications sqlalchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database twisted is a framework to program communications between computers  and is used  for example  by dropbox libraries like numpy  scipy and matplotlib allow the effective use of python in scientific computing   97   98  with specialized libraries such as biopython and astropy providing domain-specific functionality sage is a mathematical software with a " notebook " programmable in python  its library covers many aspects of mathematics  including algebra  combinatorics  numerical mathematics  number theory  and calculus python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language  including in finite element method software such as abaqus  3d parametric modeler like freecad  3d animation packages such as 3ds max  blender  cinema 4d  lightwave  houdini  maya  modo  motionbuilder  softimage  the visual effects compositor nuke  2d imaging programs like gimp   99  inkscape  scribus and paint shop pro   100  and musical notation program or scorewriter capella gnu debugger uses python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as c + + containers esri promotes python as the best choice for writing scripts in arcgis  101  it has also been used in several video games   102   103  and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in google app engine  the other two being java and go  104  python has also been used in artificial intelligence tasks  105   106   107   108  as a scripting language with module architecture  simple syntax and rich text processing tools  python is often used for natural language processing tasks  109  many operating systems include python as a standard component ; the language ships with most linux distributions  amigaos 4  freebsd  netbsd  openbsd and os x  and can be used from the terminal a number of linux distributions use installers written in python  ubuntu uses the ubiquity installer  while red hat linux and fedora use the anaconda installer gentoo linux uses python in its package management system  portage python has also seen extensive use in the information security industry  including in exploit development  110   111  most of the sugar software for the one laptop per child xo  now developed at sugar labs  is written in python  112  the raspberry pi single-board computer project has adopted python as its principal user-programming language libreoffice includes python and intends to replace java with python python scripting provider is a core feature  113  since version 4.0 from 7 february 2013 languages influenced by python  edit  python 's design and philosophy have influenced several programming languages  including  boo uses indentation  a similar syntax  and a similar object model however  boo uses static typing  as well as optional duck typing  and is closely integrated with the .net framework  114  cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax cobra 's " acknowledgements " document lists python first among languages that influenced it  115  however  cobra directly supports design-by-contract  unit tests  and optional static typing  116  ecmascript borrowed iterators  generators  and list comprehensions from python  117  go is described as incorporating the " development speed of working in a dynamic language like python "   118  groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the python design philosophy to java  119  ocaml has an optional syntax  called twt  the whitespace thing   inspired by python and haskell  120  ruby 's creator  yukihiro matsumoto  has said  " i wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than perl  and more object-oriented than python that 's why i decided to design my own language "  121  coffeescript is a programming language that cross-compiles to javascript ; it has python inspired syntax swift is a programming language invented by apple ; it has some python
