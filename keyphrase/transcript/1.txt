Network topology
(Refer slide time: 00:53)

Good day. In this lecture we will discuss the network topology. What do you mean by a network topology? (Slide reference time: 01:04 - 01:14)


(Refer slide time: 01:15 - 02:33)     

We can just have a quick recap of what we have learnt last time. Basically a computer network could be a number of nodes, which are connected by some communication links.  There is some kind of what we usually call a graph representing the network. This graph has a certain structure. We talk about the structure. This structure has an implication about how will we communicate. I said it is in general not feasible to have one-to-one communication between each pair of node. That is not possible at all. So, we need a structure formed by the nodes connected in some manner. That is the subject matter of discussion today. So a network may be represented as a graph. Nodes may represent computer or network devices like switches, routers, etc. and the links represent communication links. Modes of communication may be broadcast or point to point.  (Refer slide time: 02:34 - 02:49)

First let us talk about the LAN topologies. LAN is the local area network and local area network topologies are: star, ring and bus. We will just look at all of them.(Refer slide time: 02:59 - 04:30)

We first take up this bus topology as this is a very simple kind of network. This is based on a shared broadcast link. We want to have point-to-point communication. There may be so many nodes A, B, C, D etc., which are connected to the network. A wants to communicate to B; A specifically wants to communicate to B. So each pair of communicating nodes uses the link for the short time. So A uses the link for the short time to send his message to B. After that is over may be C might send something to D or something like that. So other nodes ignore the communication. Since this is shared broadcast link, all the links are shared by all the nodes for the communication. Hence that is not private in that sense. So all the nodes get that communication but they usually ignore this communication whereas B will copy this for its own purpose. There has to be a distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link; otherwise, communications will   collide in that shared broadcast medium. The communication of both the pairs of node will get garbled. But we want A, B and C, D to get clear signal so there has to be some
distributed protocol to decide who gets to use the link. (Refer slide time: 05:12 - 05:59)

Now let us see bus topology. What do we require? The simplest thing is a single cable.   A single cable connects all the computers. It is as if the computers are hanging from the single cable. Each computer is connected to this shared cable. So computers must synchronize and allow only one computer to transmit at a time as per a protocol. But as such, the network is very simple network with a single copper cable (Refer slide time: 06:00 - 06:26)


So this is the picture of a bus. We have this shared cable and computers are somehow connected to this. So A will communicate to B. B will simply broadcast over this medium. B will capture it. C, D, E, etc. will all ignore this. (Refer slide time: 06:27 - 08:25)

The network is maintained by the single cable. Cable segment must end with a terminator. Otherwise, what will happen is that when some node, let us say A sends a signal on the cable not only  C, D, etc. will  get it but it will get reflected from that other end if it is not properly terminated. So it becomes a kind of unwanted noise in the medium which we do not want. So the coaxial cable is used. There are two types of coaxial cables traditionally used. One is a thin coaxial cable called thin LAN and the thick coaxial cable called thick LAN and extra stations can be added in a daisy chain manner. This technology is sort of getting outdated at the moment. You still have maybe  some thin and thick LANs here and there but mostly people are moving out of this and the main reason why the people are moving out of this is because this connection is likely to become loose and as soon as you have a loose connection you will have a problem in communication. There are some other reasons also why this technology has become obsolete these days. But still if you have shared medium, I mean the technology of using a single cable with a single broadcast medium and some machines are sharing. So this something like a bus topology. (Refer slide time: 08:26 - 10:23)

The standard which is used on this bus topology is IEEE 802.3. Actually what we do is to eliminate that cable and replace with something else. We will discuss that later. Thin Ethernet is the name of the technology when we use thin coaxial cable ? we call it 10Base2. In this 10 stands for that it has a 10 Mbps speed whereas 2 stands for the maximum range of segment length of 200 meters. The maximum number of connections is about 30 devices. Four repeaters may be used to a total cable length of 1000 meters. If you want to have a very long cable, what will happen is that, as the signal travels down the line, the signal will get weak and as the signal gets weak you have to regenerate the signal and one way to regenerate the signal is to use a repeater over there. The repeater will simply take the incoming weak signal, amplify it and send the stronger signal down the line. The maximum number of nodes that you can handle here is about 150 (Refer slide time: 10:24 - 11:03)



Thick Ethernet, which is the other version where you use a thick coaxial cable called 10Base5, also has the same speed of 10 megabits per second but length up to 500 meters. So they were used for backbones that are limited to 500 meters with a maximum of 100 nodes per segment. That is somewhat more than a thin net and a total of four repeaters of 2500 meters. That is also somewhat more than thin net. (Refer slide time: 11:05 - 12:42)


Now the bus topology has both advantages and disadvantages. It is very inexpensive as you have a simple cable. It is easy to add stations. You can have another punch on this cable and add new station that means a new computer. The amount of cable it uses is also much less and may be, it works well for very small networks. It is of course  no longer recommended which means you will not get these parts any longer. It is getting out of fashion because it is unreliable. This is much less reliable than the technology that we have today. The other disadvantage is that the limited number of devices that can be attached. It is difficult to isolate the problems. If there is a problem, then the whole network is down. Sharing the same cable slows the response rates (Refer slide time: 12:43 - 13:30)

Now we come to direct point-to-point communication. That means this is not shared. So this is some kind of a dedicated point-to-point communication. So computers are connected by communication channels that each connect exactly two computers. They are dedicated for this pair. So this forms either a mesh or a point-to-point communication, and thus a complete graph. We will come to that later. This is some point-to-point network. That means there is a dedicated link between some pairs of nodes. It allows flexibility in communication, hardware, and packet formats and also provides security and privacy because communication channels are not shared (Refer slide time: 13:52 - 14:25)
    
With point-to-point network, the network will look somewhat like this. We have these two nodes or three nodes may be connected like this. If we have four nodes and we want to interconnect everybody then we require six such cables. As the number of nodes goes to N the number of cables you require is going to be NC2 which is N (N ? 1)/2 which is approximately equal to N2 which means the number of cables and the total length of cables that is involved are really increasing. But the kind of cable which is usually used  is not as expensive as the previous thin LAN or the thick LAN. At the same time the amount of cable that you require becomes very high. Hence  this kind of structure is not really recommended for a local area network. Suppose you have, say, 10 nodes in a network and you are connecting everything to everything. That means every node to every other node and length of the cable for some reason, let us say, is not an issue. But then each node will be connected to 9 other nodes. This means that in this particular computer you will require 9 ports to which these cables will be connected. But that is not so easy to provide and this is another reason why, in a local area network, this kind of mesh topology is not recommended. We have an alternative for that. (Refer slide time: 15:55 - 16:02)

 We are coming to that alternative. Another reason why you cannot connect everybody to everybody else can be illustrated thus: suppose there are two different buildings. Now	the length of the cable will really become enormous because if you have N cables on one side and M cables, N nodes on one side and M nodes on the other side,  you have a total of M ? N number of cables which are running between two different buildings. It is lot of cables really. So if we want to reduce the number of communication channels we have to (Refer slide time: 16:34 - 17:18)

basically give up the idea of communicating directly in a LAN. It means that necessarily we share the connections among many computers. There are ways of doing this by multiplexing. Here the computer takes turns in a very orderly fashion. That is called time division multiplexing and it also must include some technique for synchronizing the use. That means whoever wants to use that shared channel has to wait for his turn (Refer slide time: 16:34-17.18)

We now come to this other topology, which is very common these days. It is star topology. A star topology looks like this. There is a central hub (the centre of the wheel is called a hub) and a number of nodes are connected to this hub. I may at this stage mention that there is a physical topology and a logical topology. This is a star topology because it looks like a star. Its physical topology is that it looks like a star. Sometimes the hub is made in such a way that still this is a shared medium. What is the advantage of converting to what was previously a bus? It has some practical utility in the sense that (although the length of the cable is more in this case) the cable is a different kind of cable. The cable connections are much better. They do not get disconnected very often. Furthermore when you bring all the connections together centrally, you can handle the connections at one central point. Whereas, if you have a long running cable, it will be difficult to locate loose connections. We will have to find out failures by going around so that becomes a bit difficult. So the physical star topology still maintains a logical bus topology, which is an important thing. Otherwise this hub or the central node may not be a shared medium at all. This is often the case these days (Refer slide time: 19:49 - 20:49)



Of course the previous star diagram is idealized. Usually you will have something like this. You have this hub somewhere and then you have these different computers connected and there is a number which is written over here: RJ-45 connector which is the kind of connection which has become almost ubiquitous. These cables are something like the kind of cables which connect your telephones. They are called UTP cables or unshielded twisted pair cables. They are basically easier to handle and are also cheaper. These connections go on to the RJ-45 connectors on both sides. They are much more reliable than the previous thin LAN or thick LAN but the physical diagram may look something like this. (Refer slide time: 20:50 - 21:36)

You can have an extended star topology, which means different stars may be there, which  are connected in some manner. That means the hubs in those stars are connected and those hubs may be shared but may not be shared medium at all. They may be what are known as switches. These switches are connected. If you look at this diagram, you have these different switches and from each switch we have a star connection to the different computers and the switches are connected in some fashion. You can call this also as a star. This is called extended star topology (Refer slide time: 20:50-21:36)

You may have a hybrid topology. Some part of the network may be on a shared medium Some part, maybe, is not shared and even in some part, you could also have a coaxial cable running, leaving a thin LAN or thick LAN although that is becoming less common these days. (Refer slide time: 22:04 - 23:03)

Now we come to another topology, which is also very important topology, called as ring topology. In ring topology, computers are connected in a closed loop. This has a lot of advantage. The way it works is that the first node passes the data to the second node; the second one passes the data to the third and so on. The data will go on hopping around the ring and what will happen is that, as it reaches the destination, if it will go around in a loop, it will surely reach the destination at some point of time. The destination will copy the same. In practice there is a short connected cable from the computer to the ring. Ring connections may run past offices with connector cables to sockets in the offices. (Refer slide time: 23:04 - 25:45)

This is an example of a ring topology. Actually, there are two rings. In a ring the data will always go in only one direction. If your destination is on the wrong side then the data has to come over the whole loop and then reach the destination. So there is one ring for that. What is the other ring for? We put two rings or sometimes may be even three or four (two is quite common). One important reason for putting two rings is that if there is a failure in the network there is a possibility of the communication still going on.  Look at the picture B. Let us say one particular node has come down. That means, there is some problem in this thing. If these nodes can sense that this has really gone down, they will sort of wrap the ring around. Now physically this still looks like a broken ring. But if you look at it as a single ring, this is still a ring going through the nodes. These nodes can still communicate although there is a breakage over here. Either this node may break or this link may fail. So many things may happen. So this fault tolerance is one good reason for using rings. Especially in the wide area network, we have a lot of things. For example, let us say, these telephone exchanges are connected in some fashion using fiber optics cable. We will be talking about all those things later on. But they usually put them on a ring because if the cable is cut at some place they can still communicate by using the trick that I have just shown. (Refer slide time: 25:46 - 28:24)

This is the summary of the characteristics of the ring topology. There is no beginning or end. It is actually a ring. All devices have equal access to media. One good thing about it is that all of them should get data at some particular point of time. So they have equal access to this media. In a single ring, data travels in one direction. Only a double ring allows fault tolerance. Each device has to wait its turn to transmit. That means you cannot start transmitting as soon as you want to transmit. You have to take your turn; and most common type is the token ring. Token ring has got its IEEE standard number (IEEE 802.5). In a token ring what happens is that the token contains the data. It reaches the destination. Data is extracted, acknowledgement of receipt sent back to transmitting device, removed, empty token passed for another device to use. That is one way a ring can be used. For example, you make a data packet with this token as well as whatever you want to send to the final user. So this whole packet will go over to the next node in the ring this way, it keeps hopping from one node to another till the destination when the destination gets this packet, it knows that. The destination had this or some kind of identification which will be there somehow in this whole bunch of data. The destination node will know that this is meant for it. It will extract the data. It may be put in an acknowledgement if you are using the protocol which uses acknowledgement and send it along the ring. It will go around the ring and come back to the original sender and the sender will know that this data has been received. That will remove this acknowledgement also and the empty token is passed and this token keeps on circulating in the ring. Whoever wants to transmit has to wait till it gets the token .As soon as it gets the empty token it will put in the data that it wants to send and send it along in the same way. (Refer slide time: 28:25 - 30:07)

Ring topology has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that, Data packets travel at great speed. Now one reason why data packets can travel at great speed is that this is a very synchronous operation. If you remember that in a shared medium where the nodes are not synchronizing their actions, what might happen is that two different nodes may start transmitting at the same time and then their data will collide in the broadcast medium, hence killing both the communications. Here such a thing cannot happen because it has all been synchronized with the help of the token. There are others ways of synchronization. We will come to all that later on. Data packets can travel at great speeds. There are no collisions. It is easier to find faults and rectify faults and terminators are not required as in an ordinary cable. The disadvantages are: it requires more cable than a bus and a couple of breakdowns may bring the entire ring down. Smaller rings exist nowadays but anyway they are not very common. This is not as common as the bus so far as the local area network is concerned. In a wide area network a ring is very common. As a matter of fact the ring is the most common topology that wide area network could use. (Refer slide time: 30:08 - 31:00)

Many LAN technologies that use ring topology use token passing for synchronized access to the ring. The ring itself is treated as a single shared communication medium. Bits pass from transmitter past other computers, and are copied by destination. Hardware should be designed to pass token even if attached computer is out of commission. This is a small technicality. If the interface of the computer to the ring can function independently of the computer, that will be nice, because even if the computer is shut down, other people?s communications are not affected. (Refer slide time: 31:01 - 31:38)

This is a picture of the token ring, in which the sender holding token transmits bits of frames. Computer not holding the token passes the bits as they go around, circulate at a very high speed. The destination passes the bits but it makes a copy and the sender receives the bits of a frame and it goes out. This is one way the network could work. (Refer slide time: 31:39 - 31:53)



When a computer wants to transmit, it waits for the token after transmission. Computer transmits token on the ring to the next computer ready to transmit. It receives token and then transmits. This token ring was originally part of a LAN technology. (Refer slide time: 31:54 - 34:22)

But then it fell into disuse. First of all the token ring devices were less common. They were more costly. Hence the token ring as a dominant LAN technology went out with time but one version of it called FDDI lived on and that lived on due to the very specific advantage that the ring topology has which is fault tolerance. This technology is called FDDI. In a FDDI, the ring is made of fiber optic cables. Multi mode fibers or even single mode fibers can be used. They use fiber optic cables in which we can send data at a fairly high speed. But the speed available is not comparable to the level possible. Nowadays  FDDI technology is also not that new. It is aging and that way its speed may sound less today. But when it was proposed it was taken as a very high speed. The basic reason why somebody still would like to use FDDI is its inherent fault tolerance capability. That is the technology, which is used in LAN, and it is fault tolerant. Ring technology, which is fault tolerant, is extensively used. Some other technology is extensively used in WAN but in the LAN we have this FDDI technology whose full form is fiber distributed data interconnect. This is another about ring technology which uses fiber optic between stations, which transmits data at 100 Mbps. When we were talking about the thin LAN and the thick LAN we were talking about 10 Mbps speed ? 100 Mbps was  an order of magnitude high when it was proposed. It uses pairs of fibers to form two concentric rings in order to get the fault tolerance we require with two fibers or two rings. (Refer slide time: 34:23 - 35:48)

As soon as a fault occurs somewhere, the FDDI will automatically switch off and communication will not get disturbed. Furthermore you can have hybrid topology in the sense that you can have a ring, which emanates from the various nodes of the rings. Stars   will form; they will be the different hubs of the different stars and these different hubs can be put in a ring. As a matter of fact, this is the very common way how FDDI is configured. Some FDDI switches form a ring and from each of these FDDI switches, we can start other kind of technologies like Ethernet etc., which form a tree-like structure. The  other reason why you could have hybrid topology is that older networks are updated and replaced, leaving some older segments. You have replaced one part of network; you will get a hybrid kind of topology. Thus it combines two or different more different types of topologies. The common one is star bus or star ring. Star ring uses an MAU (multi-station access unit), which is basically a part of FDDI. (Refer slide time: 35:54 - 38:48)

Next we take up the study of Mesh Topology. By a mesh or a full mesh, it is meant a complete graph as shown here. As discussed earlier, a complete mesh would take a lot of cable. But at the same time with complete mesh we have lot of alternative paths from any node to any other node. The diagram shows eight nodes and each one of them is connected to every other node now. Between any two nodes, you will have direct path and indirect paths as well. We have many paths for going from the same source to the same destination. This means that when one of the links breaks, all of them can  still communicate without any problem. As this arrangement takes lot of cables, we do not use this. What we use is a partial mesh. In a partial mesh some of these links would be dropped, taking care that none of the nodes becomes disconnected. But all the links of the mesh need not be there even in the partial mesh. We can still have some form of redundancy and thus have some level of fault tolerance. But it may be not as much as one available in a full mesh. For such a partial mesh the network topology is not well  specified and it is difficult to evolve a protocol like token passing protocol.                                                                   So here you have to have some other method of sensing the faults and correcting them. That becomes more complicated but the partial mesh topology is used in many places. (Refer slide time: 38:49 - 39:55)


Mesh Topology of course is not common on LANs. These are most often used in WANs to interconnect LANs because WAN links usually are costly. The users of a WAN link naturally expect a certain grade of service. That is why the WAN service providers usually keep alternative paths. If one of the paths becomes unavailable due to some node failure or due to some link failure then it can still send the traffic across the WAN through some alternative paths. (Refer slide time: 39:56 - 40:35)

So the pros and cons of mesh topology are like this. The advantage is of course it improves fault tolerance and it can carry more data. The disadvantages of course are increased cost installation, difficulty in management and troubleshooting. (Slide Reference time: 40:41 - 41:20)
                                                    

Now we have seen that each of these topologies has advantages as well as disadvantages. Rings ease synchronization, but it may be disabled if a cable breaks. Star is easier to manage and more robust but it requires more cable. Bus requires fewer cables, may be disabled if cable breaks and is not so reliable. Bus would not have fault tolerance really. So as far as the LAN is concerned, people are gravitating towards star topology. That means some nodes or some computers may be connected to a switch and then some other computers may be connected to some other switch and then these switches will get connected in some fashion. Extended star topology is the most common topology as this is emerging in local area networks. In wide area networks we have both ring as well as mesh topologies. (Refer slide time: 41:21-46:12)




 


The physical and the logical topologies may be different. Something will look like a physical star but it may actually be a ring. Let us look at the following examples. Suppose you have this as the hub of the star and we have these three stations A, B, and C; we have say cable ducts running over there like this, through which a number of cables are passing. At the central hub you might connect two cables like this and then more pairs of cables in a similar manner. Because this is one central place you can do this. What you essentially have is a ring. What you essentially have is a ring. Similarly, you can have any other kind of topology. Suppose you have a number of cables coming in like this. Now if we have a connection like this and similarly in all other places, then you can actually have a mesh. Although all this is within one physical duct and another physical duct going to nodes A, B, C, and D, it looks very much like a physical star but the actual connection is something like a mesh. Just as I could make a star, I could make it a mesh also. The media is the physical topology whereas the way in which data access the medium and transmits packets is the logical topology. A LAN at a network is not always revealing. Cables emerging from a hub do not make it necessarily a star topology. It may actually be a bus or a ring. In a star topology, there is some piece of network box, which is called a hub. This hub actually replaces the single cable. This is again a shared medium. If they are connected like a star it has got the star connection. People use hubs these days but they do not use the single cable like thin LAN and thick LAN. Though it looks like a star, depending upon what kind of box it is, it could be actually a bus. Similarly as I have shown you, it could be a ring also. (Refer slide time: 46:14 - 47:27) 


Now the choice of logical topology is going to affect the physical topology and of course the other way around. The kind of physical topology you will have will also dictate the kind of logical topology that you can have. The kind of logical topology you can have will depend on two things ? one the actual physical topology, the number of cables you have etc., another is the type of network boxes like switches, hubs or whatever you have as the nodes. We have to design carefully because it may be difficult to change the part way through the installation. When you think about designing a network, you have to put the physical topology min place to get the correct logical topology. Your choice will determine cable installation network, network connections and protocols and spots where you will drill holes in the building. (Refer slide time:  47:33 - 50:48)

The different factors which you take into account while deciding on a particular topology are: the first thing that comes is what kind of technology you are going to use ? there are different kinds of LAN technologies ? for example, if you are using FDDI, then you have to have a logical ring somewhere. If you are using the Ethernet, you may have an extended star topology. The kind of technology you are using is a factor and of course this technology will have some cost benefit. As a matter of fact, in a LAN, you will find that apart from the network boxes (in Greenfield kind of situation), the cost of the cable is also significant. Then there is a question of scalability. Often what people will do is that, they will work with one kind of network and then, very soon, the network will get choked or people will want more bandwidth or more users will join. This keeps on happening. A network is never a stable thing in any organization; but whenever you are putting some kind of topology or some kind of technology you have to think that 3 years to 5 years down the line, you will have to scale the network up. You may have to change the number of your network boxes; some of the boxes for example in old technology you may have had a bus. By putting in a hub it was a physical star, but it is a bus now. You put a switch over there and make it a star topology kind of thing and then later on people want more bandwidth. When more people want to join, you have to design your physical topology that way for scalability, the bandwidth capacity and the ease of installation because how you take the cables around and how you scale up down and how you can install it are always problems. Ease of finding fault is another important factor. We will talk more about it in the next class. It is good to have a central cabling plan where all cables are coming. You can manage all your cables in one central place .There are standards like structured cabling which are used for easy fault finding and maintenance. 
Thank you! 

Preview of next lecture
Good day!  Today we will be talking about multiplexing (Refer slide time:  51:15 - 51:18)


 (Refer slide time:  51:25 - 51:32)

Multiplexing is about sharing a medium. Different users share the same                         medium for communication at the same time.(Refer slide time:  51:40 - 52:00)

A medium can normally carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there they are going to interfere and then the signals will get garbled .For multiple signals to share one medium, the medium must somehow be divided to give each signal a portion of total bandwidth. A particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource as far as communication is concerned. We try to use this bandwidth somehow to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers.That is the idea of multiplexing. There are various reasons why we want to use multiplexing and the chief one is that of transmission services which are 
(Refer slide time:  52:43 - 53:35)

very expensive . In leased lines packet switched networks, for example, laying of line in itself  fairly expensive and complex proposition and once you lay a line you really like to utilize it to the maximum. The other thing is that, if you can use that for the maximum amount of communication multiplexing and compression techniques save a lot of money for the business. When you can send a lot of data through the same line the data capacity of the line increases It becomes more cost effective for the company .Most data devices individually require  modest amount of data but with a number of users their aggregated  requirements  may occupy quite a substantial bandwidth (Refer slide time:  53:52 - 54:03)


 The current technique to accomplish this include frequency division multiplexing, wavelength division multiplexing, time division multiplexing and code division multiplexing. (Refer slide time: 54:04 - 54:49)

In the scheme of multiplexing , you have one multiplexer and then you have n  inputs on one side .So these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer. They are getting mixed  in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link .On the other side, depending on how you have put them together, they are separated into different lines. These different lines can now go to different recipients. On the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here. A number of sender receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in between (Refer slide time:  54:50 - 55:32)

The alternative to multiplexing should be direct point to point connection. This has number of problems .First problem is that you need those lines that we need for each device. You thus need a large amount of wiring. If they are on different floors, you need large number of IO ports on the computer side, which really is not feasible. You may have a few IO ports, but you cannot have hundreds of IO ports. It is really difficult to have hundreds of IO ports .That is also another bottleneck . (Refer slide time: 55:33 - 55:54)

 In a somewhat older approach (multi drop line), the host polls machine to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines. Total communications load is not greater than the rate of line. (Refer slide time:  55:55 - 56:15)
 	
Using a multiplexer approach all the device data?s are multiplexed on one side, sent through one a line. Out link carries multiple channels of information (Refer slide time: 56:16 - 56:20)

The signal will be restored depending on the quantum of noise present .If the noise is  high then  we will lose some information. There will be some distortion and some loss of information would be there. In case of digital signals it is more fault tolerant and more resilient compared to analog signals (Refer slide time: 57:01 - 57:17)


We can correct errors in transmission. Using digital signals we add few bytes of error checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected. I will give you  a simple example : suppose we are sending groups of eight bits called byte Now what can we do is that associated with each byte we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make  the number of ones in whole nine bits to be odd . This is an example of odd parity. Now if at the receiver end we find that the number of ones have become even we know that, some bits must have flipped that means some bits must instead of zero have got a one and instead of one we got a zero. It must have happened otherwise because the number of bits are supposed to be odd and of course by adding one bit we can always dictate that the number of bits in the original. That means the sending station was odd .In that case  the receiver may request the sender to retransmit the whole bunch once again hopefully there will not be error next time This is of course a very primitive kind of error checking. There are more sophisticated error checking methods employed in networks and communications (Refer slide time: 58:40 - 58:48)

 Physical Medium - I
Good day. In this third lecture we will be looking at Physical Medium. In the last lecture we have seen two protocol stacks, we have seen OSI protocol stack in detail and we had a look at its CPI pre reference stack. But whatever be the model, at the bottom-most layer you have the physical medium because, after all, if two computers have to communicate, there has to be some physical medium between them. So we will just look at some general characteristics of physical medium and how data can travel along them, today. In the next lecture we are going to look at some specific media which are used in networks. (Refer slide time: 01:36 - 2:26) 


As we talk about the Physical Medium, we have to talk about two different modes of communication, so to say. One is Analog and the other is Digital, so you have before you that top one is the analog signal; you can see that it can take any shape, and the digital signal is some kind of signal, which represents a series of ones and zeros ? stream of bits, but analog signals of course can take any value in them. (Refer slide time: 2:27 - 3:20)


And one important consideration for any medium is its bandwidth. Bandwidth is the capacity of a media to carry information. Now, the total capacity may be divided into channels ? I mean there is one total capacity you can sort of divide it into channels ? and  give different channels to different users; specific portion of the channel may not be used for direct communication but for control purpose and other specific purpose. But whatever it is, any particular medium and technology will have a certain capacity and this is really important because, after all, your speed of communication will depend on the capacity of the medium. (Refer slide time: 3:21 - 5:19 ) 


This inherent capacity of the medium is of course intermittently linked with the kind of signal one particular channel can carry. For example, on the left-hand side, you see some digital signal and just on its right you have something that looks like a bargraph ? actually this is a representation of the same signal in a different way, what this right-hand side says is basically if you have a series of
a Sin x + b sin 2x + c sin 3x + d sin 4x and so on 
 where a, b, c, d represent the values shown by the graph on the right-hand side, if you sum all that sin values up, you will get the signal on the left-hand side. So the channel, if it has to carry the digital signal, has to be able to carry all these harmonics ? harmonics means the sin x constant, sin 2x constant, sin 3 etc. So all these harmonics it should be able to carry; whereas if you look at the second figure b, it is a pure sin wave. So this just has one harmonic, a sin x or something like that. This third figure has two harmonics, say a sin x + b sin 2 x; so depending on the complexity of the wave form that you want to carry, you want more and more bandwidth for the channel. (Refer slide time: 5:20 - 6:24)


Now for this we make a comparison of analog verses digital signals. Digital signals have some basic advantages the most basic advantages is that it is that less error prone that means if there is some kind of distortion in the signal between the source and destination that can be rectified very easily and to limited extent errors can be corrected. Whereas if you are talking about analog signal there is little control over signal distortion of course this also old technology and this has got some limitations in technology in the sense that how many people can use, etc. There are some limitations over here. So digital signals are of course in general preferred, although analog signal still rules in some niche areas (Refer slide time: 6:25 - 07:30)



So let us see what we mean by the statement that digital signals are less error-prone. In this figure we see in the left-hand side have some analog signal and then some noise has  come; that means, some distortion has come and the signal looks like the one below.   When noise affects an analog signal, it is hard to deduce the original signal from this whereas the same kind of noise or a similar kind of noise if it is gets superimposed on the  digital signal as we see on the right, the signal gets distorted, but since we know that the original signal was sort of square shaped, we can deduce the original signal from the distorted signal. So, despite the noise, noise can be eliminated easily in digital communication. That is the greatest advantage of the digital communication. (Refer slide time: 07:31 -8:51 )


And so far as the bandwidth of a channel is concerned, suppose we know the bandwidth (H) of the channel and the number of signal levels (V) being used, what is the maximum number of bits that we could transmit? Suppose we are trying to transmit bits in terms of digital signal; so there is a Nyquist limit. It says that 
maximum bits per second = 2 * H * log2 V
for example if the bandwidth is 3100 Hz and we are using 16 level modulation then the maximum number of bits per second is log2 (16) is four so 4 ? 2 ? 3100, that is 24800 bps 24.8 kbps. So this is the maximum number of bits that we can send through the channel of this particular bandwidth. So the higher the bandwidth of the channel, the higher the number of bits that we can send through it, but depending on the bandwidth, there is always a hard limit on how fast we can communicate. (Refer slide time: 8:52-10:42)


Let us look at this regeneration of the digital signals once more. We say that it is reliable because it can regenerate slightly damaged signals. Since there are only two states, for example, this is the original signal, which is a square, and it is grossly distorted as it is received. This becomes weaker in strength and the shape has also been deformed but we can regenerate it since we know that the original shape of the signal must have been a square one. So we regenerate it as a square one. If there are two states of a voltage, let us say, + 10 volts ? 10 volts and the signal is + 8 volts, let us say, then it is quite possible that this that this + 8 volts is a result of noise, which is superimposed on + 10 volts rather than a result of noise superimposed on ?10 volts. So whenever you get +8 volts, simply make it 10 volts with some electronics and the original signal will be restored. Of course I mean if the noise is very high, there is a limit to how much you can restore. If the noise is very high then it will not be possible then we will know because ? 10 volts also becomes 8 volts in the case of a spike, and then whatever restoration we do will be a wrong one. So we lose some information; there will be some distortion and some loss of information will be there. So there is always a limit but in the case of digital signals it is more fault-tolerant or resistant to noise, more resilient compared to analog signals. (Refer slide time: 10:42 - 12:34)

So we can correct errors in transmission ? that is another advantage of digital signals. So what we do is that we add a few bytes of error-checking information and can ask for retransmission if an error is detected. I will give you a simple example: suppose we are sending groups of 8 bits called bytes; now what we can do is that associated with each byte, we can add an extra byte and this extra byte would make let us say the number of 1s in the whole 9 bits to be odd, this is an example of an odd parity. Now, if at the receiver?s end, we find that the number of 1s have become even, we know that some bit must have flipped. That means, some bit must have flipped; instead of a 0, we got 1 and instead of a 1, we got a 0. It must have happened. Otherwise, because the number of bits was supposed to be odd ? and of course by adding 1, we can always dictate the number of bits in the original that the sending station was odd ? in that case the receiver may request the sender to retransmit that whole bunch once again; hopefully there will not be an error next time. This is of course a very primitive kind of error-checking; there are more sophisticated error-checking methods employed in networks and communication. So this  error-checking and correction of error at the receiver?s end is possible if you have adopted a very sophisticated coding technique. So that is possible in case of digital transmission; this is not possible in analog transmission.  (Refer slide time:  12:36-14:04) 
      
Another advantage is that a digital signal can be encrypted, which makes it possible to carry sensitive information on the network. For example, e-banking is coming in vogue ? that means, somebody does a bank transaction on the network. Similarly e-commerce ? that means you want to buy something online and then pay through your credit card, etc. online. Now how does the transaction take place? The point is that you are sending some information, may be your credit card number, may be some password, etc. Somebody can snoop on you in-between, so they will know your secrets and use the same set of numbers  to may be buy something else, and the money will go from your bank account; that is obviously not acceptable. In this case when we send it down the network, we encrypt it in a way that even if somebody snoops and finds out the stream of bits that is going, he will not be able to make out the original numbers from this current stream. So this is encryption and this is a very important application these days. (Refer slide time: 14:05 - 15:54)  
      
So encryption is another advantage of digital transmission. Compression is another; that means, we can compress a message before transmission and decompress it at the other end. So the overall load on the circuit and the network is lighter; since the load is lighter it is less expensive. Sometimes when you compress information there may be some loss of information; there are lossy compression techniques and they are non-lossy compression techniques. Lossy compression technique is where you may lose some information, but it may not matter. For example, let us say you want to send a digital photograph. A digital photograph may have a very high resolution; if you compress it and decompress on the other end, you may lose a few bits but the image that you get on the other end would still look almost as good as the original one. Of course, trained persons can look at it and find out there is something missing but it will almost serve the purpose.  Sometimes loss compression is acceptable and of course there is loss-less compression also. When you compress it and send it, it is a less expensive way of sending. I mean you are sending the same information but only your are taking less amount of space; of course you have to do the compression and decompression at the two ends, so that is some kind of overhead on the two sides. (Refer slide time: 15:55 - 17:07)

Suppose we have some data; how do we encode this digitally? Well, the simplest way, of course, is by the presence or absence of a signal. Let us say a positive voltage might represent a binary zero or a binary one or vice versa. Maybe if you have high voltage, you say that is I will interpret that is as one being sent and if I have a low voltage I interpret this as a zero being sent. Of course, when I am saying voltage, I am assuming that we are having some kind of electrical signal traveling; that is not always the case. For example, if you are using light for communication the presence of light may indicate one and the absence of light may indicate zero. So whatever we code it, whatever be the medium, this is the simplest wave to encode data into a digital form. The current state indicates the value of the data. (Refer slide time: 17:08 - 18:31)

If your signal is digital, sometimes you are forced to send some digital signal by analog transmission, but this is usually not preferred. Analog signal will transmit whatever signal comes regardless of whether it represents digital or analog data. So it uses amplifiers. Other than the kind of regeneration that is possible in digital voice, the trouble with amplifiers is that it also boosts noise, whereas in the digital case we could take out the noise and regenerate the original shape of the signal. Here we can amplify it, so that if a signal becomes weak we can make it stronger; but whatever noise is coming with the signal that also gets amplified. This is okay for voice, but for digital data using analog transmission usually is not done because we have so little control over the correctness of whatever we are sending. (Refer slide time: 18:32-19:58)


Digital transmission is concerned with the content of the signal; it uses repeaters which recover the pattern of zeros and ones and then retransmits. This can be used with analog signal if it carries digital data. You know sometimes analog signal carries digital data; it recovers the digital data from the analog signal, generates new clean analog signal. This is becoming more standard; for example, when you are connecting to the network, to the internet, from your home computer you may have use the modem and the telephone connection. Now what is happening over here is that the telephone line is essentially an analog medium; so an analog signal will go over there on that, but whatever is coming out of your computer is digital. So what you do is that you make this digital data ride on some analog signals to this modem pairs so that it reaches the telephone exchange. At the telephone exchange it is converted back to digital data and the backbone and the core of the telephony system is purely digital. (Refer slide time: 19:59 - 22:26)

So there are various ways in which you can encode digital information in the analog domain. One is the amplitude shift keying, which means the two binary numbers 0 and 1 are represented by two different amplitudes of carrier waves. This is not very efficient; uses up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines; and is used to transmit digital data over optical fiber. In the amplitude shift keying, although the signal is analog we know that there are only two levels, which this signal is supposed to take, i.e., two amplitudes: low amplitude and high amplitude. It may be 0 and some amplitude. If a 1 is to be transmitted may be we give this high amplitude and if a 0 is to be transmitted, we may use a low amplitude analog signal. You may say this is the kind of thing which is done in the optical domain; but in the electrical domain this is not very efficient. More common is the so-called frequency shift keying. In frequency shift keying, we use the two binaries; that means we use two different frequencies for the two binary digits, 0 and 1. So this is less susceptible to error than amplitude shift keying, and again, it sends up to 1.2 kbps on voice grade lines and is commonly used for high-frequency radio. Another way of encoding is the so-called phase shift keying. Two binary numbers may be represented by phase shift of carrier wave; so this is more efficient and noise resistant than FSK; this is PSK. It can be raised up to 9.6 kbps (kilo bits per second) on a voice grade line. This is for a simple phase shift keying; of course, we use more complex phase shift keying with other techniques in order to achieve even higher data rates nowadays. (Refer slide time: 22:27 - 24:01)

These techniques can be combined. So it is common to combine phase shift and amplitude shift keying so we can get about 56 kbps on a voice grade line. The modems that we buy usually are all 56 kbps, connected with some technique called multilevel signaling. Each signal represents more then one bit. So this is also possible. One is the signal, which indicates the level of the voltage or whatever it is, the phase or frequency, the level of the signal; the other is the bit or bits that it may represent. So, for example, if you have a simple technique, it will represent a 0 or a 1 by the current level of the signal, which is the simplest kind of technique, these two are the same. One is the bit rate, that is, the number of bits of information that you are sending; the other is the baud rate, that is, the number of times the signal will change per second ? the maximum number of times the signal will change per second. So in the simplest case, baud rate and bit rate may be the same but that is not always the case. (Refer slide time: 24:02 - 29:29)

So we look at the other side of the coin, which is the digital encoding of analog information. And a very common case is the telephones. For example, as I just now told you, the heart of the telephone exchanges and the telephone switches and the trunk exchanges and the core network of the telephone system are nowadays entirely digital. Whereas our voice, of course, is analog. By the way, the real world, in which we move around, is mostly analog. Now this digital is something that we adopt in-between in order to get these advantages of robustness, resiliency, error correction, etc. Our voice is analog, but the core telephone system is digital. So at some point, our voice, an analog signal, has to be converted into a digital signal. Of course, our handsets also are mostly analog. So they are going to be carried may be in this analog fashion right up to the nearest exchange; but there, there will be a set of codecs, coders and decoders, which will convert this analog voice signal to a digital signal. Now, what kind of digital signal will a voice give? The calculation is something like this: the voice data in a telephone system is limited to a maximum of 4 KHz. This telephone is a very good quality, the first so-called gold quality but this is not high fidelity kind of sound. It is less than high fidelity, but very very clear, for all practical purposes for the telephone at least. If I limit the bandwidth to 4 KHz, we get some distortion, but nothing very noticeable. So voice is still very clear. We have to send this 4 KHz of analog signal, whatever information is there, within 4 KHz bandwidth. We have to send this analog signal to the other side in a digital form; that is, we have to digitize it. There is a Nyquist rate, which is like the Nyquist limit that we have seen some time back. Nyquist rate, which says that if we sample any analog signal at double the maximum frequency that the particular analog signal has, then essentially we will have all the information that is needed to fully reconstruct the original analog signal from this sample. So if you have 4 KHz of signal, 4 KHz of bandwidth, we require 8000 samples per second. Let us say you have this analog voice; so per second we will take 8000 samples, sample values at different points. So, of course, at some points my voice may be low so I may have a small amplitude; at some point my voice may be very high so I can have a large amplitude. Now that we break up each of these into a code of 8 bits, the point is that with the 8 bits, you can really distinguish between 256 levels. And our assumption is that from the 0 level to the highest level that is admissible, we take it; whatever it is, if you break it up in to 256 parts, that is good enough for capturing how high or low the volume is. So a level of 256 is really quite a lot. We require 8 bits for each of the sample and we require 8000 samples. That makes it 8 ? 8, that is, 64 kilo bits per second, 64 Kbps. Please remember this rate ? 64 kilo bits per second ? it is the fundamental unit on which a whole lot of all other technology, etc. has been built. And basically, it has come especially from telephony, because the telephone people had the first network and 64 kbps happened to be the rate which was set for a voice. So naturally, of course, if you want to carry 1 voice channel, we will have a 64 kbps. If you want to carry 1000 voice channels, you will require 64 kbps ? 1000, that is, 64 mbps capacity. So they planned their network depending on how many voice channels they want to carry where; but 64 kbps is the basic unit in most places in telecommunications. (Refer slide time: 29:31 - 32:53)

Now let us take a quick look at how data is encoded. The simplest one is of course using the level of the voltage; for example, over here this is the non return to zero level, the so-called NRZ encoding. It uses two different voltage levels to represent 0s and 1s; typically negative voltage equals 1 and positive voltage equals 0 and the signal never returns to 0 voltage. So it flip flops between a negative voltage and a positive voltage. The value during bit time is a level voltage; that means, during the duration of a bit 0 or 1 the voltage really remains the same. So there is a transition at the boundaries of bit and of course, if there are two 1s then there will be no transition as we can see; if there are two 0s consecutively, then there will be no transition. So the number of transition is much less and it is a very simple kind of scheme. This has some problem. We will come to that later on; but let us look at another variant of this non return to zero, which is NRZI. That means non return to zero and invert on 1s. That means once again we keep constant voltage during bit time ? no transition represents 0 and transition from low to high or from high to low is a 1. So the same bit pattern, 0 0 1 1 0 1 is represented by a different voltage pattern over here. There is no transition 0 0 and then there is a 1, so there is a transition; there is another 1, there is a transition; 0 no transition; then again the 1, then another transition. So this is another way of encoding. Now the trouble with these encodings is that suppose you have a large number of 0s, a large train of 0s, there is no transition really. By the way, there is one point ? the reason they use the positive voltage and negative voltage rather than a positive voltage and zero voltage or zero voltage and negative voltage is that you want to distinguish between a 0 being sent and no signal being sent. So that is one point and the other point is that as I was saying if there is a constant train of 0s in the original data then we will have a constant level signal in the system. Now if that be so, the synchronization of the clocks between the sender and the receiver tends to drift off and then the receiver, I mean in the worst case, the signal may go one off or it may interpret the signal in a very wrong fashion. So this is the problem of this NRZ and NRZI, which is taken care of (Refer slide time: 32:54 - 33:46)


by some other kind of encoding; we will come to that later on. So this is a just a quick look at the disadvantages of NRZ code ? hard to tell where one bit ends or starts; with long string of 0s or 1s, any drift between timing of transmitter and receiver results in errors. So there is a bit phase encoding, which uses the least transition per bit time. So if you use at least one transition per bit time, what would happen is that the sender and the receiver clocks can remain in very close synchronization with each other ? that is a nice property ? and there is predictable bit transition during each bit time. So an absence of a transition indicates an error. So two examples are Manchester and differential Manchesters (Refer slide time: 33:47-34:29)

So this is Manchester encoding. You see that at the middle of each bit 0 or 1, 
there is a transition. Now, low to high transition means 1 and high to low transition means 0. So the same pattern ? 0 0 1 1 0 1 ? is there for each bit; you will see there is a transition in-between, and low to high transition is 1 and high to low transition is a 0. So this is the encoding, which is used in Ethernets and many LANS (Refer slide time: 30- 35:42)

There is another variant of this called differential Manchester; in this, the midbit transmission is really for clock synchronization purposes. They do not represent either 0 or 1. So what it does is that transition at the beginning of a bit period is equal to 0 and the absence of a transition is bit period 1. So 0 0 ? when this 0 starts, there is a transition. Transition at the beginning of the bit period is a 0; but when the 1 starts, there is no transition. There is a transition in the middle anyway; that is for clocking purpose. Then at the next level, once again if there is no transition if there is a second one coming, there is no transition and so on. This was used in token ring networks; of course token ring networks are becoming less popular these days but anyway, this is another one. There are other kinds of encoding techniques, but these are the common ones. So you see that there are different ways of encoding the digital data into these different signal levels. (Refer slide time: 35:43 - 38:29)

Signal levels and bit rates are different. The rate at which the signals change is the baud rate, and the rate at which bits are sent is the bit rate. The other thing we can consider is the analog encoding of analog information. Of course, this does not come too much in computer networks, but this is an important area in communications in general. So of course, if you have an analog signal, it can directly be sent. Sometimes it is sent in the raw form; sometimes that is not very practical, so we have to convert this to an analog signal maybe at higher frequency, and the most common example of this is the radio. For example, a radio is carrying voice or may be some sound, etc. The voice, as you know, is only 4 KHz, but if you take a 4 KHz signal and try to send it over the atmosphere, it will not reach any where, excepting in its close vicinity. So, in order to reach out to all these different locations, you have to send your radio signal at a very high frequency; but the information that is it carrying is still at that 4 KHz bandwidth. So this 4 KHz bandwidth is sort of translated; so there is a very high-frequency so-called carrier wave, which is carrying this 4 KHz of signal if it is only voice. Of course if it is music, etc., you may like to have a somewhat higher bandwidth also; but anyway, that is also analog signal and this is also analog signal. So one analog signal is carrying the other analog signal and there are various ways of doing this so-called modulation. The three most common ones are amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and phase modulation. So we will not talk much about this because in amplitude modulation as you can understand, the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal; similarly, in frequency modulation the frequency of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal; and then in PM the phase is changed according to the signal. (Refer slide time: 38:30 -39:58)

So this is another picture of digital signaling so called current state; that means zero represents the low voltage one is represented by the high voltage and digital signaling and state transition; so if there is no transition that is zero if there is a transition that is the one so these are all different examples of encoding. (Refer slide time: 38:59 - 39:35)	










As I was telling, the bit rate and the baud rate are different. The maximum number of times a signal can change in a second is called the baud rate and the number of bits, 1s and 0s transmitted in a second is called the bit rate. In the examples we have seen so far, the bit rate and baud rate are the same; this is not always the case. The bit rate can be higher than the baud rate if we use more then two signal levels; and the other one is also possible: the bit rate may be lower than the baud rate. (Refer slide time: 39:36 - 41:15)

Now let us look at some of the inherent trouble with all these physical media. That means, when we are throwing some signal, when we are trying to send some signal down some transmission medium ? it may be a piece of wire it may be this whole atmosphere or it may be a fiber optic cable ? there will be some kind of distortion, some kind of change in the original signal, that will inevitably come into play. So we will look at some of these; we have to really take care of all these. These signals and these kinds of effects cannot be eliminated. I mean the world is not perfect and they are basic properties of the medium so we will have to design our systems in such a way that in spite of all these efforts the whole communication will still go on very correctly. As a signal propagates, the signal changes as it travels; so the receiver may not be able to recognize it as such. For example, this shows an example of an original signal and the final signal. This kind of change and distortion etc. may be attributed to the following effects: (Refer slide time: 41:16 - 42:51)

the first one, the very first one, is attenuation. A signal get weaker as it propagates; attenuation becomes greater with distance naturally, and of course, finally, the signal will become too weak to recognize. So the original signal strength is something but as the distance grows signals become weaker and weaker. For example, let us say this kind of weakening is dependent on the property of the medium; it also depends on the kind of frequency you are using for sending. For example, let us say an AM signal will not be received at a very large distance, whereas a short wave signal may travel some other way and come over here. Similarly, if you take a local area network or a cable, then if you make the cable very long ? there are other technical problems for making cable very long ? but even from the signal propagation point of view, the signal will get weaker and weaker. Because there will be leakage currents in the cable, current will leak out, etc. Finally, the signal that we will get will be very weak. So this is a very fundamental property of any medium. Similarly, if you take an optical medium and if you send a light pulse through it, as it travels, the light pulse will get weaker ? that is one of the effects. There are other effects, but this is one of the major effects. (Refer slide time: 42:51 - 44:27)

Apart from attenuation, there is distortion. That means, the signal changes shapes as it propagates. Now if it changes shapes in this way, the adjacent bits may overlap, may make recognition impossible for the receiver, so what might happen if the signal changes shape? Why does it change the shape? If you remember in the very beginning I had shown you one slide of a square wave kind and we talked about some harmonics. So the square wave may be looked upon as a sum of all these harmonics, a sum of all these sign waves. Now all the harmonics or sign waves are of different frequencies ? we had talked about the sin x sin 2 x and sin 3 x and so on ? so they are of different frequencies. Now signals of different frequencies change or get affected by the medium differently. So a signal of a particular frequency may be attenuated less; the signal at a much higher frequency may be attenuated much more or vice versa. The point is that signals at different frequencies will get affected by the medium in different ways. So finally, the relative strengths of the different frequencies will be different when you go to the far end; that means, when you go to the receiving end, when you add that all up, you will get a different shape. You will not get the old square shape or whatever shape you have sent; you will not get that back. So this is called distortion. (Refer slide time: 44:27 - 45:31)

Then, of course, it is going to pick up noise. There is thermal energy in wire, which is everywhere. So this energy is some kind of inherent noise that will always come; then there will be random signals. So spikes may sometimes occur; say, some car is starting somewhere so there will be some static discharge; the lightning strikes somewhere, there is somebody running a motor, somebody is running a washing machine, all these things add to the general noise in our atmosphere and this medium, which is carrying a signal, will also catch some of this noise. Sometimes of course, the noise is so sharp that it may  change the transmission in such a manner that you will not get the original signal back. So sometimes such a thing may happen. (Refer slide time: 45:31 - 46:47)

What we want is a high signal-to-noise ratio in order to distinguish between the signal and the noise. If the noise is very low and the signal is high, we can still distinguish at the receiving end between what is a signal and what is a noise and take the signal out, take out the noise. But for this we want a high signal-to-noise ratio. Signal strength divided by the average noise strength is the SNR and as SNR falls, error will increase. So in this figure, you can see that as the signal becomes weaker and weaker and touches the noise floor may be goes below it. When it goes below it, the noise becomes more than the signal; then no meaningful communication can be carried out. So in general, we want a strong signal-to-noise ratio. So one thing we might do quite often is that suppose we do have to send a signal to a very long distance, the signal will naturally get weak. So in-between, we will put some amplifiers or repeaters or regenerators, which will take the signal, try to filter out the noises as much as possible, then amplify the signal and make it stronger, and then push it for the next span. So after some distance, again another repeater will take it up and regenerate the signals. We have to go on doing that so that I maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio even at the receiving end. (Refer slide time: 47:26 - 47:38)

Then of course, as I said that, there is interference. That means energy from outside the wire adds to signal, like noise, which is often intermittent, and is very hard to control or diagnose. (Refer slide time: 47:38 - 48:49)

One important point is that a very strong interference can occur at cable termination. So there are two things: first of all, if two cables are running in parallel, what might happen is the signal in one may affect the signal in the other. So there is some kind of linkage between the two the so-called cross talk ? that is one thing. This is more pronounced at the termination end; at the termination end, if you do not terminate the thing properly, if you just leave it like this, the kind of distortion and the kind of noise that will be introduced will be much more. So whenever we are putting some wired kind of network infrastructure, we have to be very careful about the termination, because that is where a lot of noise can come in. So often there will be multiple wires in a bundle; each radiates some of its signal, causes interference in nearby wires and this is especially bad at terminations where wires are unwound and are parallel. (Refer slide time: 48:49 - 49:36)

Finally I just mentioned this, that when carrying digital data over analog lines, we require modems. Modem stands for modulation and demodulation. This is used to connect a digital computer to an analog phone system usually, but modems can also be used elsewhere. It can be installed internally or a card inserted into the motherboard or can be connected to the serial port, etc. So now we understand why modems are required because essentially, digital data will have to be carried on the analog system. The field of communication, as you know, is a very interesting field and we could not go too much into the details of communications. But we have just talked about the very basics of communications used in computer networks, because remember computer network or some computers or some network nodes are connected via some communication lines. So communication is absolutely important; it is all-important in this; so we have talked about this.In the next lecture, we will look at some of the medium that is actually used or deployed in common networks. Thank you.

Physical Medium - II

Today we will ] have the second lecture on the physical media in the last lecture we have seen the different ways  the digital signals and analog signals, etc how they can be used for communication how digital data or analog data can be encoded and some of the general  impairments of physical medium. in this lecture we are going to look at specific media which are used in networking (Refer slide time: 51:18 - 51:20)


 (Refer slide time: 51:21 ? 52:30)


so there are basically two types of  mediawhich are used for communication one is cable i mean they are two different classes are together so one is a cable  now this cable  could be some  copper cable they could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair so the twisted pair I mean we sometimes there actually unshielded twisted pair or UTP sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common there are shielded twisted pairs also and then  of course the one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic these are the different types of cables that we use in networks. similarly we can also communicate without the use of any cables by simple electromagnetic radiation and these radiation could be in different ranges of the frequencies like they could be infrared or microwave or radio or satellite. etc So we will look at all these  one by one (Refer slide time: 52:31 - 55:25)



first let us look at the kind of  media that we use in a LAN. LAN as you remember is a local area network and a local area network could vary from let us say one meter to one kilometer so its is local strictly by some means of size in some way so one meter means two computer connected siding on the same table connected side by side it could be all the  computer in one building and all the  computers in several buildings and so on so that is the kind of range that we have for LAN . and the medium that we use for LAN they could be coaxial cables, UTP, fibers, wireless so you would note that basically most of the types of cables that we talk about find their way  in some ways or other  in local area networks. and of course UTP or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories so that cat is for categories so we could have cat3 cable cat 5cable, cat 5e cable, cat 6 cable, cat 7 cable and so on .You must have seen cat 3 cable if you looked all your telephones that is the landline phones they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of categories three.  for computer networking I mean cat three cables could also be used for LAN although we usually prefer cat five onwards.  the kind of things  that are on the network that could be PBX, PBX is your local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports etc. Ethernet is one technology which is used in LAN ATM is also used, FDDI is sometimes used FDDI if you remember is fiber distributed  that is the FDDI ring kind of structure. so  there are some networks even smaller than LAN. they have called personal area networks some networks so i may have be varying three or four computers and they or connected in a network on my body. o we will come to pan later on but  going on the other side of the spectrum that means from LAN to a bigger network this is man that is a metropolitan area network. typically one campus or one city may be several small towns which are closed together they would come under the preview of the MAN, so MAN by ballpark figure man would be extent of about ten kilometers, so it could be 5 kilometers or it could be twenty kilometers so something in that range (Refer slide time: 55:26 ? 57:48)

and the kind of medium that we use for a metropolitan area networks coaxial cables both base band and broadband, we will come to this what they are. sometime UTP are used but that is not very preferred way of  connecting although UTP are  used one way UTP is definitely used are when you try to network to telephone lines. That is I mean telephone linesi  told you they use UTP. it could be a hybrid kind of system, some part of it could be coaxial some part of it could be UTP and some part of it could be fiber. fiber means , fiber optic cables. and kind of things of course that kind of technology that goes into a MAN would be PBX different kinds of modems for example if you are using a broad band coaxial cable you might use something what is known as a cable modem . then you have this long  Ethernet that means on the Ethernet on the over may be some lines cable tv DSL digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless. one issue which is important in MAN is the issue of access alright that means how do you reach to each individual users.I mean  think of a town or a city so you  really have to in order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost ok, if it is a small building like in a LAN you can take very  good say UTP cable to his room . now there are problems of taking UTP cable to each individual house I mean  there could be i mean electromagnetic disturbance and things like that  but apart from that there is a question of cost. Ok if you are trying to build so much copper into that is quite costly. so how to access to users who are distributed over somewhat wide area in the sense of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks (Refer slide time: 57:49 - 58:41)

Finally at the extreme of the spectrum we have WAN that is wide area network so they may stretch from ten kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers, so 10000 kilometers almost to the other side of the globe.  so they can involve very very long distance . medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology that is used in WAN are SONET or SDH that the almost similar technology ATM IP that is the internet protocol, DWDM dense wavelength division multiplexing, Geo and Leo Geo stands for Geostationary satellite is a short form of Geostationary satellite and Leo is low art orbiting satellite.

Good day. Today we will have the second lecture on the Physical Medium; in the last lecture we have seen the different ways these digital signals and analog signals, etc. can be used for communication, and how digital data or analog data can be encoded. Well, we are mostly interested in the digital form of data, how they can be encoded etc., and some of the general impairments of physical medium. In this lecture we are going to look at specific media, which are used in networking. (Refer slide time: 01:33 ? 01:34) 

Refer slide time:  01:34 ? 02:43)



There are basically two types of media, which are used for communication: one is cable. They are actually two classes of cable. Now this cable could be copper cable or could be coaxial cable or twisted pair or shielded twisted pair. The twisted pairs are actually unshielded twisted pairs or UTP. Sometimes we simply called them twisted pairs since they are more common; there are shielded twisted pairs also. Then, one of the most important cables these days is the fiber optic. These are the different types of cables that we use in networks. Similarly, we can also communicate without the use of any cable, by simple electromagnetic radiation and this radiation could be in different ranges of frequencies, like infrared or microwave or radio or satellite, etc. We will look at all these one by one. (Refer slide time: 02:44 ? 05:09)

First let us look at the kind of media that we use in a LAN. LAN, as you remember, is a local area network that could vary from, let us say, 1 m to 1 km. So it is local strictly by its size; 1 m means two computers connected on the same table or connected side by side; it could be all the computers in one building and all the computers in several buildings; and so on. That is the kind of range that we have for LAN. The medium that we use for LAN could be coaxial cables, UTP, fibers, and wireless. Most of the types of cables that we talked about find their way in some niche or other in local area networks and, of course, UTP or unshielded twisted pairs are of different varieties or categories. We could have Cat 3 cable, Cat 5 cable, Cat 5E cable, Cat 6 cable, Cat 7 cable and so on.You must have seen Cat 3 cable ? if you have looked in your telephones that is the landline phones, they are connected by unshielded twisted pair cables of category 3. For computer networking, Cat 3 cables could also be used for LAN, although we usually prefer Cat 5 onwards. The kind of things that are on the network could be PBX; PBX is local telephone exchange that could also have some digital ports, etc. Ethernet is one technology, which is used in LAN; ATM is also used; FDDI is sometimes used. FDDI if you remember is fiber distributed, that is, the FDDI ring kind of structure. We have network boxes like hubs, switches, routers, etc. So these are the terms you would come across. Of course we would talk about some of these in more detail later on, but these are some of the technologies that come into LAN or local area networks. (Refer slide time: 05:09 ? 07:22)

Then we come to slightly bigger networks, called MAN or Metropolitan Area Networks. There are some networks which are even smaller than a LAN; they are called Personal Area Networks. I may be wearing three or four computers and they are connected in network on my body. So we will come to PAN later on. Going on the other side of the spectrum, that means, from LAN to bigger network, which is MAN, a metropolitan area network, typically one campus or one city may be several small towns, which are close together. They would come under the purview of a MAN. MAN is a ballpark figure; it would extend may be about 10 kilometers ? so it could be 5 kilometers, or it could be 20 kilometers or something in that range. The kind of medium that we use for metropolitan area networks is coaxial cables, both base band and broadband; we will come to what they are. Sometimes UTP are used but that is not a very preferred way of connecting. One way where UTP is definitely used is when you try to network through telephone lines. UTP  could be a hybrid kind of system wherein some part of it could be coaxial and some part of it could be UTP and some part of it could be fiber. Fiber means fiber optic cables. the kind of technology that goes into a MAN would be PBX, different kinds of modems, for example if you are using a broadband coaxial cable you might use something that is known as a cable modem. Then you have this long-reach Ethernet that means Ethernet over may be some lines, cable TV DSL digital subscriber lines or it could be wireless. One issue which is important in MAN is the issue of access. That means how do you reach to each individual user? Think of it as a town or a city; you really have to. In order to network the entire town you have to reach to each individual residence and reaching to each individual residence involves cost. If it is a small building like in a LAN you can take  UTP cable to his room. There are problems of taking UTP cables to each individual house; there could be electromagnetic disturbance and things like that but apart from that there is a question of cost so if you are trying to build so much copper into it that is quite costly. So to access users who are distributed over a somewhat wide area of several kilometers that is an issue in metropolitan area networks. (Refer slide time: 08:32 ? 10:08)

Finally, at the extreme of the spectrum, we have WAN, wide area network. So they may stretch from 10 kilometers to may be 10000 kilometers or almost to the other side of the globe. They involve very very long distances. The medium is usually fiber or satellite and the kind of technology used in WAN is SONET or SDH. It?s almost similar technology ATM, IP ? that is the internet protocol ? DWDM, dense wavelength division multiplexing, Geo and Leo. Geo stands for Geostationary satellite and Leo is low art orbiting satellite. So these are the kind of technologies that go into WAN. One issue in MAN is of course always cost and bandwidth, WAN bandwidth because as you can imagine that when you have to take some message across hundreds of thousands of kilometers away there is a lot of cost involved in it. So WAN bandwidth is usually costly and we try to make the maximum use of this bandwidth. Of course in recent times lot of fiber has been laid internationally so the bandwidth problem is becoming less and less, but even then WAN bandwidth remains costly. (Refer slide time: 10:08 ? 12:43)

Now let us see some of the cable specifications that we use, first we take up this UTP cable of category 5 so CAT 5 UTP cables specification says about 100 MHz and these can stretch up to 100 meters. These are the figures which are normal, you can stretch things little bit this way or that way at times depending on your operating circumstances, etc. but this is normally the figure; so you can have some kind of idea from these. The CAT 5 cable looks like your standard telephone cable; the only thing is that they are made to a slightly better specification. The connector at the end of a CAT 5 cable has got a specific scientific number; this is called RJ 45. So we use RJ 45 connectors for connecting CAT 5 cables. There is a standard ANSI or TIA or EIA standard for how CAT 5 cable is to be used. What are the standard ways and how they are twisted, etc. There are a number of wires inside the twisted pair of cables; so which wire stands for what, etc. I simply refer to the name of the standard here, which is EIA 568 A and then a cable has to be tested according to some standards; TSB 6795 is the standard for testing cables. CAT 5 cable is usually under these circumstances 100 MHz to say 100 meters. If you are within the 100 meters, if you have done everything properly it is expected that it can work up to 100 mbps. The point is that if the distance is much less than that then naturally the same cable can work at a much higher speed. So inside the same room the CAT 5 cable may be used for 1000 mbps connection between computers or network nodes. (Refer slide time: 12:43 ? 13:26)

There is some enhanced version of CAT 5 cable; I will not go into the details of this, which are given over here. The specifications are almost the same; only thing is that this is slightly better in some way. And it can work for 1000 base TX for small distance. I said within a room if you are using CAT 5 e cable instead of simple CAT 5, you may be able to operate at 1000 mbps without much of a difficulty. (Refer slide time: 13:27 ? 15:24)

Then we have the CAT 6 cables, which is again slightly higher than CAT 5 cables here: the specification is 250 MHz. this specification is much higher; so naturally CAT 6 cable would be somewhat costlier than CAT 5 or CAT 5 e cables. The same kind of connector is actually the recommended cable for operating at 1000 mbps. So here is a point. When networking started, people thought that 10 mbps is a fairly high speed. And soon people were using networks a lot and 10 mbps was not enough, so people went to 100 mbps. Now people are saying that 100 mbps is slow; so we want to go to 1000 mbps. You see that in a comparatively short period of time, may be 15?20 years, our demand for bandwidth has grown a thousand-fold. When you are planning for an infrastructure, say copper infrastructure, in any organization or somewhere, then you should keep this in mind that whatever specification people are giving you today, after some time people may want to upgrade. What I mean to say is that if you put in CAT 6  kind of cables and use it for only 800 mbps today, then 1 or 2 years later you can use the same cable for 1000 mbps saving a lot of cost at that time; but of course, that would mean a higher upfront cost today. So that is always there. (Refer slide time: 15:25 -16:44)

So for testing these kind of cables there are all kinds of testing parameters. I will not go to the details of these at all. This is a rather technical part. Return loss is a measure of the reflected energy caused by impedance mismatch in the cabling system. When you put a cabling system you can test it. And one of the things you might test for is return loss and another thing you might test is a cross talk as reflected from the other end. ELFEXT is defined as the measure of signal coupling from a transmitter at the near end into a neighboring pair measured at the far end, relative to the received signal level on the same pair. These kinds of testing parameters are there for testing copper cables. Similarly if we have put fiber optic cable somewhere, then fiber optic cables would have some other testing parameters. It?s a good idea to test the passive networking infrastructure, meaning all these cables and connections etc., and how they perform. (Refer slide time: 16:45 ? 18:23)


Now from unshielded twisted pair cables, we go to the base band coaxial cables. We have already mentioned about the base band coaxial cables. These are the cables we were talking about when we talked about the bus topology if you remember; so it is basically a shielded cable. There is a copper cord surrounded by an insulating material, which is surrounded by braided outer conductor, which is surrounded again by a protective outer covering. So this is considerably thicker than a UTP. And then in the coaxial cables also there are two varieties, the so-called thick coaxial cable and thin coaxial cable. This technology is becoming obsolete now, but just for our knowledge, a thick coaxial cable is also presented as 10base5. This 10 represents that it works at 10 mbps and 5 represents that it can go up to 500 hundred meters. The thin coaxial cable is 10base2, so it works at 10 mbps and goes up to 200 meters. As I told you, nowadays almost everybody wants a 100 mbps to their desktop, in which case this thick and thin coaxial cables, that is the base band coaxial cables, are no longer of much use today. (Refer slide time:18:23 ? 20:57)



But another type of coaxial cable, which is very much in vogue and which is used even today, is the kind of cable that your cable operator puts. Many of you have seen that cable operator puts some kind of coaxial cable into your room, which goes into your TV. Now it is possible to use the same infrastructure for computer communications also, i.e., computer networking also. Remember, I told you while discussing MAN that one of the most important issues in metropolitan area network is the issue of access; that is, how do you reach each individual subscriber at his or her home? This cable operator has reached lot of homes anyway. So naturally, people started thinking whether we can use these cables from the cable operators for network communication, and special kinds of modems were designed for that called cable modem. So we have a broadband cable infrastructure rather than the base band that we were talking about. This is quite often used and now they are being deployed in many cities for computer communication. This is, as I said, analog signal carrying TV signals and has been used for carrying data traffic. Older cables carry up to 450 MHz and the newer cables that have been put can go to higher frequencies, that means, higher bandwidth, and these cables use amplifiers at regular intervals. Now these amplifiers in the old days were only one-way amplifiers because the way the cable operators wanted it is that they are broadcasting their signal from some central location and it just has to reach people?s TV. But when you want to use this for computer communication the communication has to be two-way so the amplifier also has to be a two-way amplifier. So such small technicalities are there; it requires an amplifier at regular intervals and is a shared medium. Usually this medium is shared, that means, you and your neighbors ? all your data is in the same medium. (Refer slide time: 20:57 ? 22:27) 



As I said, for carrying data, two-way amplification is necessary. Dual cable systems are like two trees, both rooted at the head-end; the head-end is where all the service providers? equipments etc. are placed. So there are all kinds of split systems, they use 5 to 30 MHz for inbound traffic and the rest for outbound traffic; mid-split system and there are all kinds of systems for using this for data communication. By the way, there is also some asymmetry that people have found in the network traffic for an average user in a city. One of the most popular uses of computer network nowadays is just going onto the internet, may be surfing it, may be getting some information, etc. But the amount of traffic in terms of query etc., which flows from the user to the computer, wherever it may be, is relatively small. Whereas you may be downloading large files, images, may be even songs, movies etc. Your bandwidth requirement ? the upstream bandwidth requirement and the downstream bandwidth requirement are usually not the same; there is an asymmetry. (Refer slide time: 22:27 ? 24:03)

Now we come to another very important kind of cable, having looked at copper cable, namely, optical fibers. Optical fiber basically is made of glass, very pure and very transparent silica glass is used, which is very very transparent in the sense that it can go up to tens of kilometers without too much of attenuation on the way. So think of a glass slab, which is several kilometers thick and you can see through it quiet easily, so that kind of transparency is required. So, naturally, there have to be some very strict standards for making this glass. But after all, it is simply a glass, which is drawn into fiber for giving us this optical fiber. At moderate dimensions, light is restricted to the fiber because of total internal reflection for ordinary light; this is called a multimode fiber. At still smaller dimensions, say something like 8 to 10 nanometers, the fiber acts like a wave guide for lasers. This is known as a single-mode fiber. Multimode fibers are used for local area networks whereas in all wide area networks and even in local area networks these days single-mode fibres are more preferred for carrying signals. (Refer slide time: 24:03 ? 26:55) 

Finally what is optical networking? One thing is, naturally, optical transmission. By the way, optical transmission could be fibers or free space. Free space means suppose you direct a laser from the source to the destination on the free space, light will travel straight or it is expected at least to travel straight and then reach the  receiver. So you do not need any fiber or anything at all but there is a problem. The first obvious problem is that the sender and the receiver have to be on the same line of sight without any hindrance in-between, that is one point. And then there are other complications, which might come; in the sense that the intervening air may get hot and its refractive index may change. So the light may actually bend, like they do in a mirage in a desert. That kind of things may happen, so it might miss the receiver altogether. So free space optic communication is not very much preferred. People prefer to put fiber optic cables wherever they can. These cables or free space we are talking about is for fiber optic transmission. Then there is the question of optical switching; can we provide the network level functionalities in the optical domain itself?  This is a topic of research these days as this is quite promising. So maybe we will just look at this later on. Finally, why optics? The point is that optical fiber capacity is huge, very huge ? you see 50 terabits per second is mentioned over here. The point is that this has got an absolutely fantastic bandwidth, so if you can put a fiber optic connection between two endpoints your present as well as foreseable future requirements will surely be met. So that is one good thing about optics. The other very good thing about optics is that it is immune to electromagnetic interference, if there is a lightning strike nearby, then it is not going to affect this very thin strand of glass that we have put, which is very good because if the same thing happened to a copper cable, there would be a surge and it could maybe burn some of your equipment. So this is another reason people favor fiber optics a lot. (Refer slide time: 26:55 ? 29:27)

Now the point is that this 50 terabits per second bandwidth that we were talking about is only theoretical. Actually sometimes, I have been asked what the bandwidth of this fiber optic cable is? This really does not make much sense because the bandwidth of any fiber optic cable you would find would ultimately be dictated by the kind of boxes that you connect to it. The limitations would be there; the limitation is not inherent in the fiber. Fiber can take up a huge bandwidth as I just mentioned, but at the two ends you will have some optics and then you will have some electronics. Now electronics cannot work at that kind of speed. A single piece of electronics suddenly cannot work at that kind of speed; so the overall speed at the bandwidth that you can get out of this fiber would depend on the kind of electronics that you put at the two ends. That is why there is a lot of interest these days in whether some of these electronics can be replaced by optics so that we can get much higher bandwidth. Now not content with just sending data through only one wavelength through this fiber, we have what is known as wavelength division multiplexing. That means different wavelengths of light carry different signals through the same fiber optic channel; that is called multiplexing. We will come to WDM later on. With this WDM, you can get higher kind of bandwidth. Lucent, for example, demonstrated 64 lambda; that means, 64 different wavelengths into 40 Gbps that is each of them operating at 40 gigabits per second over a distance of 4000 kilometers, so I think that is really great. There are two kinds of wavelength division multiplexing, namely, coarse wavelength division multiplexing, which is somewhat cheaper, and dense wavelength division multiplexing, which is used in WAN but is much more costly. Sothe number of wavelengths that we can use today varies from may be 8 or 12 to may be 64 or so. People are working on this ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing, which can carry us to may be 100 wavelengths in the same fiber. (Refer slide time: 29:27 ? 31:02)

For a quick history, in 1958 laser was discovered. Then in the mid-60s guided wave optics was demonstrated, in 1970, we saw the production of low loss fibers. Because we want this low loss, we will be talking about this loss presently after sometime. So this made long-distance optical transmission possible. There was the invention of semi conductor laser diode, which was important. Then in 70s to 80s we used fiber in telephony in the form of SONET or SDH. Do not bother about what they are right now; we will be talking about them later on. In mid-80s, LANs and MAN were sort of being put in place and in late 80s, we had a breakthrough in optically amplifying optical signals. So there is EDFA and RBM, dot fiber amplifier ? we will be talking about that too in this lecture itself; and then in mid- to late 90s, this dense wavelength division multiplexing system started being put and in late 90s and in 21st century optical switching systems, different components of optical switching systems are been developed all the time. The point is that fiber optics has such a tremendous potential that there was a lot of interest in this and there is a lot of work going on in this area at the moment. (Refer slide time: 31:02 ? 32:17)


So here is some kind of a picture of a cross-section of a fiber optic cable. As you can see, when you see a fiber optic cable, you will see this fad jacket, which is just a productive jacket made of plastic, rubber; then inside it, there will be glass fiber. But what you see is actually not the fiber; that is also actually a cladding but that is made of glass. Inside this cladding there is this very fine core, which actually carries the signal. In one fiber optic cable like this, you will have several such individual fibers. So these are all individual fibers. What has been shown over here are the individual fibers and each of them will carry one; I have shown only 3 over here but it is typical to have something like 4 cores, 8 cores, 24 cores, 120 cores in one cable. (Refer slide time: 32:17 ? 34:02)

Let us look at this diagram of how it is. So if you take a cross section, there is cladding on two sides and core in-between. If you sort of cut it side ways, this is the kind of picture you get and what happens is that once the light comes into the core it sort of refracts like this and it impinges on this wall at a very wide angle of incidence. There is a difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding. That is always maintained. So the point is that the core is at the higher refractive index and the cladding at lower refractive index. There is total internal reflection over here, so even if the fiber bends a little bit ? although light usually would travel straight but through this total internal reflection it would follow this fiber ? it can take small bends and come out of the other side of the fiber. But of course there are limitations to how much you can bend. First of all, if you bend this core too sharply, this core will get damaged. So there are limitations on what is your bending radius, radius of curvature, etc. but in general to this total internal reflection the light will follow this core. So this is another picture ? light is input from one end so this sort of follows the fiber and gets out of the other end. (Refer slide time: 34:02 ? 35:02)

Well the light gets out, but how do you get it into something? That means, how do you connect these fiber cables, which are actually glass fibers, how do you connect them to other things? There are two ways of termination; we can terminate a fiber by plugging it into a fiber socket and then sort of clamping them together. We can splice them mechanically by putting the two cut ends into a sleeve and clamping them or we can fuse them to form a solid, which is a better method of connecting fibers. Even when you fuse them what will happen is there will be some kind of disturbance ? that glass material will not be totally homogenous at the junction. So there will still be some loss but this loss is quite low if you are very careful in this splicing. (Referred slide time: 35:02 ? 35:27)



And what about light sources? We have two different light sources; they are called semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes. Naturally, the first one gives out lasers whereas the other one, the simple LEDs, give non-coherent lights. So they are simple LEDs. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. (Refer slide time: 35:27 ? 37:19)

When you are using the semi-conductor laser ? laser as you know is coherent light and simple LED gives you non-coherent light ? so the data rate for lasers can be much higher with lasers and this is low fiber type. You can use multimode fibers over here and you can use single mode fibers. We prefer single mode fibres for lasers. The distance that an LED can cover is short whereas the distance that single mode fibers, that means lasers, can travel through a single mode fiber is really long. So all our long-distance cables are actually single mode types and they carry laser. Since we are going to higher and higher speed all the time, we tend to prefer single mode fibers these days. Of course, LED has a very long life. So this is one area in which LED is definitely better whereas laser?s lifetime seems to be short, although not very short. If proper care is taken, they will certainly run for several years. The temperature sensitivity for LED is minor so for semiconductor laser it is substantial, so its life source has to be maintained at a particular temperature. LED naturally is low cost and laser is more expensive. These are the pros and cons of the two sources. (Refer slide time: 37:19 ? 39:06)


Let us took take a closer look at the kind of losses that we have in fiber. Remember, when we were discussing about electrical transmission through some copper medium ? we were talking about it in the last class ? there are several kinds of distortion to the signal. First of all, the signal strength tends to weaken as we go over a longer and longer distance; that is called attenuation. The same thing happens in the case of fiber also, in the sense that as we go further and further the signal will get weakened. You can look at this way that if the signal did not weaken, then we can look through a glass of any thickness. That is not true; the transparency of the glass, although it is very highly transparent, is not 100%. That is why as it travels down the fiber its strength will become lower and not only that, it will also get its wave shape and also get somewhat distorted due to certain phenomena. For example, there is this phenomena of Rayleigh Scattering; that means due to slight changes in the refractive index of the glass some of the light will get scattered. Then there are other kinds of scattering called Mie Scattering due to the imperfection of the cylindrical structure. These losses are non uniform for different wavelengths. That is why on the other end your signal will arrive first of all weakened, and secondly in a slightly distorted fashion. (Refer slide time: 39:06 ? 40:09)


This figure, this famous figure, is the plot of the loss that will happen to a light signal at different wavelengths. As you can see, this loss in the fiber, given in DB per kilometer, is not uniform. You can see that it is not uniform across all the wavelengths. So there are some wavelengths, namely here, where the loss is very low. Then there are other wavelengths where the loss is quiet high. What we do is that we try to find some kind of windows, where the loss would be low and we can go to high distance. Because, remember that if the loss is low (Refer slide time: 40:09 ?  41:17)

we can go much longer without any amplification or repeated kind of action and that is good. I mean that would make the thing cheaper and of course we would be able to carry data for longer distance. These are the three useful windows so to say: one is the 850 nanometer window, the other is the 1300 nanometer window, and another is the 1550 nanometer window. Around these wavelengths, if we send our signal, it will go a long way. So these are the three windows, which are used for data transmission. Because of the very high frequencies involved ? you can look at the frequencies from these wavelengths, you can calculate and you will see that the frequencies are very high ? it can potentially have a very huge bandwidth. So the theoretical capacity of the fiber is very high; it is limited by the optoelectronic devices and boxes at the two ends. (Refer slide time: 41:17 ? 43:23)

Now let us see if we want to take the fiber optic signal to a long distance; naturally, I mean whatever window you use after some distance depending on the kind of source you are using, the kind of frequency you are using, the quality of fiber you are using, it may be 5 kilometers or it may be 50 kilometers. But when you are going thousands of kilometers, at some point of time the signal will become very weak so you need some kind of repeater function. What is the repeater? The incoming signal may amplify or make the shape all right; so there are all kinds of repeaters. Repeaters are different gates; there are some repeaters, which simply amplify the signal. There are other repeaters, which can also make corrections to the shape of the incoming signal, etc. You need this repeater function in order to go to a very large distance. So we will just take a look at this interesting phenomenon: how do you repeat optical signals? Optical signals traveling for long distances through fiber need to be strengthened. This may be done through OLTs; now what is an OLT? That is optical line transmitter, which takes the signal to the electronic domain and, of course, you can use a fresh source over there to make a nice and strong wave form and push it for the next leg of its journey. The important thing is that this may also be done in the optical domain and the advantage of doing it in the optical domain is that you are no longer restricted by the bandwidth limitations of electronics. So you can really operate at very high speed always in the optical domain and one way to do that is with (Refer slide time: 43:24 ? 43:58)

erbium doped fiber amplifiers. So erbium has a large number of excited states and from some of the excited states it gives out 1550 nanometer light, exactly the wavelength used in the third window in the glass. So a few meters of optical fiber are doped; that means a small quantity of this erbium is introduced in that; the glass is doped with the few parts per million of erbium and is pumped with 1480 or 980 nanometer laser, to give amplification. So what would happen is (Refer slide time: 43:58 ? 44:39)

you look at this. Suppose this is the ordinary fiber, which is carrying the signal and there is some portion of it which is doped with erbium and a pump laser of certain frequency is fed into this. So what will happen is that the erbium atoms in this region will be in an excited state, so erbium will be in a excited state. When a signal photon comes, this sort of induces the erbium to come down to the ground state, giving an amplified signal. So this is a very simplified version of how erbium doped amplification is used. (Refer slide time: 44:39 ? 44:57)

There are other kinds of this; depending on what kind of pump laser you are using, you may go to this kind of excited state or this kind of excited state from which you can go to excited state one and so on. But anyway, the basic idea remains the same. (Refer slide time: 44:57 ? 45:38)

Because of dispersion, that is chromatic dispersion and polarization, mode dispersion wave shaping is necessary after some distance. There are other kinds of combination of wave forms known as solitons;  these are waves shaped specially to match the dispersion characteristics of fiber so that a soliton would not be distorted for a long distance. Distortion can also be counteracted by reverse fiber. So all kinds of technology are there; we do not have the time to go into the details of these, but this is a very up-coming and growing field. (Refer slide time: 45:38 ? 46:25) 

Once again, why do we like fiber? ? because repeaters are needed only every 50 to 100 kilometers as opposed may be 2 to 5 kilometers for copper; not affected by power surges, electromagnetic interference, power failures, corrosive chemicals, etc.; communication in a fiber is usually simplex. That means there is the source on one end, receiver on the other end, so in one fiber the data is really going in one direction. So for two-way communication, we require a pair of fibers, but these two fibers have more capacity than 1000 strands of twisted pair, and that is really really great. (Refer slide time: 46:27 ? 47:05)

We will have just one quick look at where fibers are going? People are putting fiber at a feverish pitch now. One is the ultra long hall ? ultra long hall means we have fiber for a distance of may be thousands of kilometers. Then in the long hall we have this WDM or SONET, SGAs etc., which is put by the telecom company or other communications companies. Then we have the WDM, ATM, SONET, ETHERNET, etc. in the metro, that means, within the same city, and now finally fiber is finding its way in the access side ?  that means to individual users also. (Refer slide time: 47:05 ? 47:41)

These are the different ways fibers can reach your home, which is the ultimate goal of networking. Either you can take individual fibers to homes or we can take them to a switch, which is placed in the neighborhood and from there individual fibers go to every home. There is also a concept of passive optical networking in that instead of keeping a switch out in the open, you put a passive sort of splitter, which splits the signal into so many parts. So PON, passive optical network, is another possibility. (Refer slide time: 47:41 ? 48:22)

Let us come to the other most important physical medium, namely, wireless. One disadvantage of each of the data transmission methods that we have seen so far is that they are all wired connections. Moving from a wired connection to a wireless connection results in the ability to connect a network without having a physical connection.  What is the great advantage of that? The greatest advantage of course is mobility. That means if you are connected in a wireless fashion, you can move around but still remain connected. (Refer slide time: 48:22 ? 49:24)

This entire electromagnetic spectrum is used for communication. This just shows a picture of that. On the low end we have the radio, followed by microwave, which is of a higher frequency, followed by infrared, which is of still higher frequency. Then we have the visible light; of course we talked about the fiber optics and this part has not been used for communication as yet, may be in future. These are the kind of frequencies we have. So the frequency range is tremendous ? from 104 or may be 1014 or 1015 or so. We have these twisted pairs in this region, coaxial cables, maritime signaling, AM radio, FM radio, TV, terrestrial microwave, satellite, fiber optics. By the way, radio, and sometimes TV also, terrestrial microwave, satellite are all used for computer communication also. (Refer slide time: 49:24 ? 49:40)

These are the different names for the different ranges: we have LF for low frequency, medium frequency, high frequency, very high frequency, ultra high frequency, super high frequency, extremely high frequency, and so on. (Refer slide time: 49:40 ? 50:08)

Transmitting data: data is transmitted through a wave just as with coax; that means the higher the frequency, the more the data that can be encoded and transmitted. Narrow band is often used as the number of watts/hertz is high, and there are different pros and cons at different frequency bands. We will just look at some of them. (Refer slide time: 50:08 ? 50:35)

Sometimes a wide band is used; using a wide band allows the transmitter to jump from one frequency to another in order to avoid communication jams and to hide detection. That is just one example and this is nowadays used in IEEE 802.11, which is a wireless LAN standard. We will look at this later on. Bluetooth is another wireless LAN standard (Refer slide time: 50:35 ? 51:20)

To start at the low end of the spectrum, at the radio transmission, this is very easy to generate: travels long distances and it is omni directional; that means you have an omni directional antenna and you send your signal over there. So it will travel in all directions and it will reach everybody around in a certain area. That will not happen if you are using a very high frequency like microwave; so at low frequencies, waves go to walls and power falls off sharply with distance from the source. At high frequencies waves will bounce off of obstacles. (Refer slide time: 51:20 ? 51:34)

So there is a limit to the distance that a radio wave can cover. VLF, LF, and MF bands are limited by distance on the ground. High-frequency and very high-frequency waves can be bounced off the ionosphere, sending it back to earth, which is a very important thing. (Refer slide time: 51:35 ? 52:01)

This is a picture of what might happen. In short-wave range ? you know the short wave radio ? you can listen to the radio transmission from USA. What is happening is that it is getting repeatedly reflected off the ionosphere and reaching the other end of the earth. (Refer slide time: 52:01 ? 52:23)

There are problems with this wireless communication; we will not go into all the details. First of all there will be selective kind of attenuation, then there is a very irritating thing called multipath fading. So what happens is: (Refer slide time: 52:23 ? 52:47)

for example, something like this, your signal may reach directly or your signal may reach through a path after getting reflected somewhere and these two may be out of phase. So when they are out of phase, they will sort of cancel each other and you will have a very bad signal. These are the problems we encounter in mobile phones, etc. So you have to do something about these. (Refer slide time: 52:47 ? 53:21)

For microwave transmission, the transmission can be very narrowly focused. So data can be moved from one tower to another. You may have seen those microwave towers; so they are sort of in line of sight with each other. Alignment is important because this is a focused beam. If it is not aligned, your receiver will miss the signal altogether. Beams do not pass through buildings well. These are the disadvantages of microwave. If the waves are delayed, they may arrive out of sync, which is known as multipath fading. (Refer slide time: 53:21 ? 54:13)

Finally, we have infrared and millimeter waves at the very high end of these; of course, we have talked about optical fiber. They are mainly used for short-range communication and they are strictly directional. As we are going more towards the light, it is becoming more and more directed, as light is very directed. So they are directional, cheap, and easy to use but they don?t pass through solid objects. You cannot use them for a mobile phone, let us say, but you can use them for controlling your TV or for short-range connection to your computer from some handheld device, etc. So this can be an advantage or disadvantage ? one way of looking at it is that since it does not go through walls, whatever you do in one room is going to not affect whatever you are doing in the other room. So that may be an advantage also. We tried to cover all the different ranges that we use in communication; we have the satellites. Also. as I mentioned, you have this geostationary satellites, which are nothing but repeaters on the sky. (Refer slide time: 54:36 ? 54:50)

So we can sort of send the signal from earth to the satellite, where it will be amplified and sent it back to earth. These satellites could be geostationary or the satellites could be sort of low, earth orbiting satellites. So they are also used for communication over long distances.

Multiplexing
(Shareing a Medium)
Today we will talk about Multiplexing (Refer slide: 55:27- 55:34)

Multiplexing is about sharing a medium that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time (Refer slide time:55:42 ? 59:54)

Another  simplest condition a medium can  carry one signal at any moment  because if there are two signals over  there  they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garble but for multiple signals can share one medium the medium must somehow be divided giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth if you remember that a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this band width is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned so what we tried to do is that we tried to use this bandwidth some how to to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers so that is the idea of multiplexing (Refer slide time : 56:34 ? 56:43)

these line increases  it becomes more cost effective for the company  and most data devices individually the require modest amount of data but when the when a number of users their requirement are aggregated together the sum total may be  quite substantial band width. (Refer slide time: 56:55 ? 57:10)

the current technique accomplish this includes frequency division multiplexing wavelength division multiplexing  time division multiplexing  and code division multiplexing  we will look at many of  some of these at least(Refer slide time: 57:10- 57:55)

Let us see so this is the scheme of multiplexing  you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side so these n inputs are coming to the same multiplexer they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same  physical link and on the other side depending on in which fashion you have put them together they started separated in two different lines so these now these different lines in the right they  can now go to different recipients so  just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers over here so the so a number of sender receiver pair is utilizing  the same physical link in (Refer slide time:  57:57 ? 58:12)

Now to for the types of multiplexer as I mentioned that we have  FDM that is the frequency division multiplexing, TDM that is the time division multiplexing,  STDM that is the statistical time division multiplexing so we will look at  these (Refer slide time: 58:11 ? 58:36)

Just quickly before we go into get into the details of each of these time division multiplexing each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth that means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time for a small burst of time after that it is somebody else  so we will look at the details of this later

Multiplexing 
(Sharing a Medium)
(Refer slide time: 00:53)
Good day. Today we will talk about multiplexing. 
(Refer slide: 00:56 - 1:08)

Multiplexing is about sharing a medium; that means different users are sharing the same medium for communication at the same time. (Refer slide time: 1:09 - 2:13)

Under the simplest condition, a medium can carry one signal at any moment because if there are two signals over there, they are going to interfere and then the signal will get garbled; but for multiple signals to share one medium, the medium must somehow be divided, giving each signal a portion of the total bandwidth. If you remember, a particular frequency range around one particular frequency is called bandwidth and this bandwidth is the most valuable resource so far as communication is concerned. We try to use this bandwidth to facilitate the communication between a number of pairs of senders and receivers. That is the idea of multiplexing. There are various reasons we want to use multiplexing, (Refer slide time: 2:15 - 3:20)

and the chief one is that transmission service is very expensive ? leased line, packet switching networks, etc. For example, laying of lines is in itself fairly expensive and a complex proposition and once you lay a line you like to utilize it to the maximum. If you can use that for the maximum amount of communication, multiplexing and compression techniques are the techniques, which we use for this purpose ? it saves a lot of money for the business. When you can send a lot of data through the same line, the data capacity of the line increases, it becomes more cost-effective for the company; most data devices individually require modest amount of data but when there are a number of users, their requirements are aggregated together and the sum total may be of quite a substantial bandwidth. 
(Refer slide time: 3:21 - 3:32)

The current techniques that can accomplish this include: frequency division multiplexing, wavelength division multiplexing, time division multiplexing, and code division multiplexing. We will look at some of these, at least. (Refer slide time: 3:33 - 4:19)

This is the scheme of multiplexing; you have one multiplexer and then you have n inputs on one side. These n inputs have come to the same multiplexer; they are getting mixed up in some fashion and they are being sent over the same physical link. 
And on the other side, depending on the fashion in which you have put them together, they have separated into different lines. These different lines on the right can now go to different recipients. So just as on the left we have different senders and we have different receivers,  a number of sender?receiver pairs are utilizing the same physical link in-between.  (Refer slide time: 4:20 - 5:01)

The alternative to multiplexing should be direct point-to-point connection; this has a number of problems. The first problem is that you need those lines that we were talking about, you need lines for each device, and you need a large amount of wiring, if they are on different floors. Another important point is that you need a lot of I/O ports on the computer side, which really is not feasible. You may have a few I/O ports, but you cannot have hundreds of I/O ports, it?s really difficult to have hundreds of I/O ports there. That is also another bottleneck that we wish to address. (Refer slide time: 5:02 - 5:22)


Another approach could be, a somewhat older approach, which is that of a multi-drop line. The host polls machines to see who wants to send and then uses the same lines, saves I/O port; the total communications load is not greater than the data rate of line. (Refer slide time: 5:23 - 5:42)

These are actually the simple approaches. Using a multiplexer approach, all the devices, their data is multiplexed on one side, sent through one line, and the number of lines in is equal to the number of lines out; the link carries multiple channels of information. (Refer slide time: 5:43 - 5:59)

The types of multiplexer we have are: FDM, that is, frequency division multiplexing; TDM, that is, time division multiplexing; STDM, that is, statistical time division multiplexing. We will look at these. (Refer slide time: 6:0 - 6:26)

Just quickly before we get into the details of each of these, in time-division multiplexing, each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth. That means the entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time, for a small burst of time. After that it is somebody else?s time. We will look at the details of this later. 
(Refer slide time: 6:26 - 6:51)

Another common approach is the frequency division multiplexing; here the frequency spectrum is divided among the logical channels. Here we have only one physical channel, but we want to have a number of logical channels, so the frequency spectrum of the channel is divided, each user has exclusive access to his channel. (Refer slide time: 6:52 - 8:52)

This FDM sends signals in several distinct frequency ranges: one of the oldest uses of frequency division multiplexing is in radio. For example, we have this electromagnetic field in our atmosphere, let us say, through which electromagnetic radiation can pass. Electromagnetic radiation can be of very large range of bandwidth, the whole range of bandwidth is there. Out of that, the so-called radio frequencies constitute one part of it, a fairly important part of it. This whole bandwidth of radio frequencies is divided into small channels and each channel is given to one particular station. And on the receiver side, on the radio side, what we do is that we tune our radio, let us say, to one particular frequency, so that it receives signal from that particular station only; although a number of stations are all transmitting at the same time. This is an example of multiplexing. Another example of multiplexing, the same frequency division multiplexing, we see nowadays in the cable TV. The cable TV providers give one cable, one coaxial cable to the premise connected to the TV. That one coaxial cable apparently is carrying a number of channels, may be hundreds of channels these days. What is done once again is that, all the frequencies, which can travel down this cable, are broken into a number of logical channels and each channel is dedicated to one particular station. That is how we carry multiple video channels on a single cable. (Refer slide time: 8:53 - 10:10)

Of course I mean point-to-point is out of question. Imagine the cost of stringing wire for each channel; you?ll have a hundred cables coming into your building which is not really possible. Each signal is modulated on to a different carrier frequency; carrier frequencies are separated by guard bands. This guard band is important because one particular channel, maybe a radio channel or a TV channel, the principle is the same everywhere. So, that uses some middle frequency, maybe some range of frequencies. The next station maybe a TV station or a radio station ? whatever it is, that can occupy; first of all that has to be non-overlapping. The range of frequencies which is assigned to the second station has to be non-overlapping with the range of frequencies which is given to the first station and not only that, between these two there must be some separation in frequencies. Otherwise what will happen is these two signals are going to interfere with each other. So that is a guard band. (Refer slide time: 10:11 - 10:17)

The bandwidth of the transmission medium exceeds required bandwidth of all signals because of these guard bands which have to come in-between. (Refer slide time: 10:18 - 11:02)

Usually for frequency division multiplexing, analog signaling is used to transmit signals. Broadcast radio and television, cable television and amps cellular phone system use frequency division multiplexing. Amps is an old cellular phone system that was there in USA. Nowadays of course, the kind of cellular technology that we have in our country uses more complex multiplexing techniques, maybe I?ll mention that later on. These systems all use frequency division multiplexing. This technique is the oldest of the multiplexing techniques. (Refer slide time: 11:03 - 11:22)

Assignment of non-overlapping frequency ranges to each user or signal on a medium ?all signals are transmitted at the same time, each using different frequencies. A multiplexer accepts inputs and assigns frequencies to each device. (Refer slide time: 11:21 - 12:07)

The multiplexer is attached to a high-speed communications line because all these frequency bands on individual users are going to adapt to a fat range of frequencies. The communication line must be able to handle this whole frequency range or in other words, the communication line has to be high speed. A corresponding multiplexer or demultiplexer is on the end of the high-speed line and separates the multiplexed signals, because on the other end you have to separate them out. Since it involves analog signaling, it is more susceptible to noise. Thus we have seen that the analog signals are more susceptible to noise. In digital signals we can sort of clean the noise more easily. (Refer slide time: 12:08 - 12:52)

This is a diagram. If you note that for a particular user, suppose user 1, we give channel 1; along the time this channel 1 is entirely dedicated to user 1 for all time. Similarly channel 2, which is at a different frequency ? frequency is on this side and time is on this side ? once again user 2 gets to use this frequency for the whole time. This is the simplest kind of scheme, so that for this whole frequency band, frequency is being divided, which is why it is called frequency division multiplexing. (Refer slide time: 12:52 - 13:13)

As was mentioned, the frequency channel is divided into logical channels; each user hangs on to a particular frequency, the radio spectrum and a radio are examples of the media and the mechanism of extending information from the media. (Refer slide time: 13:13 - 12:07)

This is another picture of the same thing, see channel 1 and then channel 2, channel 3 ? they all send some signals. If you plot them across the frequency versus the signal strength, you get a picture like this, so this is the first channel, this is the second channel and this is the third channel. In-between this part here is the so-called guard band. This frequency is not used by either of them. There is some overlapping due to noise and other issues; we will not get into that;  due to that this is what it looks like, the frequency bands are all separated. (Refer slide time: 14:05 - 14:47)

Here is another diagram which shows, let?s say you have the host and a 300 bps line; a number of 300 bits per second lines are being multiplexed to 1200 bps line and then there are some guard bands: maybe 300 to 1013 Hz is one and then 1433 to 2206 Hz is another line; maybe 2686 to 3400 Hz is another line. These are the 300 bps sub-channels and you have the guard bands in-between. On the other side again you have this multiplexer?demultiplexer, which takes it to different users. (Refer slide time: 14:48 - 15:35)

One problem with FDM is that it cannot utilize the full capacity of the cable. It is important that the frequency bands do not overlap so that is why you have to give the guard bands, so the full capacity of the cable is not utilized. The other disadvantage ? we will summarize these advantages and disadvantages later on ? is that it is sort of bit more prone to noise because we are dealing with analog signals. FDM is usually used to carry analog signals although modulated digital signals can also be sent using this technique. (Refer slide time:15:35 - 16:22)

We have another type of multiplexing, which is wavelength division multiplexing. Wavelength division multiplexing is the same as the frequency division multiplexing. Only thing is that here the operating frequencies are much higher, actually they are in the optical range; that is why somehow it is given different name like wavelength division multiplexing, you know different wavelengths means different frequencies. If you are doing wavelength division it is same as doing frequency division and this is used in optical fibers. This is the same as FDM but applied to fibers. (Refer slide time: 16:23 - 17:08)

There?s a great potential for fibers since the bandwidth is very huge. As I mentioned, the operating frequencies are very high, even a slight percentage diviation from the mean operating frequency gives you a very large bandwidth. So you can sort of compact or pack a lot of channels at those high frequencies. Fibers have a large bandwidth capacity and with different energy bands are passed through a diffraction grating prism combined on the long distant link and then split at the destination. This is got high reliability as well as high capacity, two very interesting properties. (Refer slide time: 17:08 - 18:23)

So multiplexing and demultiplexing for a wavelength division multiplexing is of course very simple. If you take a prism, you know if you send a white light through a prism it breaks up into all the different colours, because the refractive index of the prism varies with the frequency. So different frequency can come in,  you can make the same light source also to say in this and on the other side you can use a prism to break it up. Of course I have shown a prism here for simplicity; usually something like a diffraction grating is used. So if you look at the fiber spectrum, if you plot the power versus the frequency so one fiber maybe giving at this frequency, another fiber maybe delivering power at this frequency. If you put them together simply then you get this power versus ? or power versus ?, kind of plot that you get (Refer slide time: 18:24 - 19:37)

Wavelength division multiplexing multiplexes multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic line. Different wavelength lasers called  ?s; traditionally ? is used for denoting a wavelength, some are quite extensively used in this optical communication domain. Different frequencies are  called different ?s and they transmit multiple signals. Each signal carried on the fiber can be transmitted at a different rate from the other signals. This is one very interesting thing of fiber that is, different colours although they may get mixed but finally again they will be separated. What rate of data, what protocol etc. are they carrying? The fiber system is really transparent to all that so that is a good thing ? different systems can be put to the same fiber. As I mentioned that fiber have a very high capacity so you get to push in a lot of channels into the same fiber. (Refer slide time: 19:39 - 21:09 )

Dense wavelength division multiplexing also called DWDM. They may combine as many as 30, 40, 50, 60 or more channels these days into one fiber and each of these channels has a very high capacity; so DWDM channel has a very high capacity and it is improving all the time. People are finding ways of packing more ?s into the same fiber and it is supposed to be quite scalable into the future; but of course if you want to pack those wavelengths in a very dense fashion, your equipment becomes somewhat costly. A cheaper alternative which has come up recently which are called CWDM so Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing is called DWDM, cheaper version is called Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing or CWDM. In this CWDM the channels are more widely spaced on the spectrum. Multiplexer, demultiplexer, and all these costs go down and become cheaper alternatives but still you can push in a number of wavelengths into the same fiber. Now we come to the other very important multiplexing technique called Time Division Multiplexing. (Refer slide time: 21:10 - 22:10)

As a matter of fact this is extensively used in our computer communication or telecommunication. Time division multiplexing is very extensively used especially on the service provider side; we will look at these later on. Sharing of the signal is accomplished in time division multiplexing by dividing the available transmission time on a medium among users; so time is being divided. What is done is that, as I mentioned before, that each user gets a small burst of time in which at that time the entire channel and the entire bandwidth is at his disposal; but as soon as that short duration of time is over, then it is somebody else?s turn to send and this maybe in a round-robin fashion after some time it will come back to the original user, so that he can send his next burst of data or voice or whatever it is. (Refer slide time: 22:12 - 22:40 ) 

Usually we use digital signaling in time division multiplexing, almost always. Digital signaling is used almost exclusively. Time division multiplexing comes in two basic forms: one is synchronous time division multiplexing, the other is statistical or asynchronous time division multiplexing. We will look at synchronous time division multiplexing first and because that is the simpler scheme and then you will look at statistical multiplexing (Refer slide time: 22:41 - 23:42)

So the same multiplexing scheme now looks like this. If this is the frequency, the same plot if you remember in the previous diagram when we were doing TDM we were slicing this channel in this fashion. We are now slicing it in this fashion; that means time is divided; channel 1 channel 2, channel 3, channel 4, channel 5, channel 6; they get the entire frequency range for a small burst of time. And suppose only 6 channels are being multiplexed, after 6 again it will be the turn of channel 1. So channel 1 sends the first burst of data  etc. using the entire frequency band during this time period and then during this time period. During this time channel 1 is not sending anything so it is quiescent. Time is getting divided in this fashion, this is why this is called time division multiplexing. (Refer slide time: 23:45 - 25:23)

This is a schematic of a time division multiplexing system. Like FDM time division multiplexing saves money by allowing more than one telephone call to use a cable at the same time. You have terminal 1, terminal 2 and terminal 3. Terminal 1 is giving at this particular time then terminal 2 and this terminal 3. And over here on the other side this sequence and the way it goes that is known that has to be known; so whatever signal comes at one particular slot; this multiplexer knows that this must be for receiver number 1 and next slot is for receiver number 2 and next slot for receiver number 3. So on the receiver side, it just knows if it is this time slot, it is for a particular user. This is a synchronous division multiplexing because this clock and this clock have to be synchronized otherwise, there will be a problem. Instead of dividing the cable frequency bands, TDM splits cable usage into time slots.  Each channel is given a regular time slot in which to send a PCM signal. (Refer slide time: 25:25 - 27:41 )

 This is another view of the same time division multiplexing. Actually in actual practice, we will go into the details of this later on. Actually this time division multiplexing can be done in a hierarchy of manner. We will look at this hierarchy later on. If you remember from our digital signals discussion, that our voice, because it is up to say 4 kHz is our voice signal, because of Nyquist theorem, we require 8 kilo samples; that means double the rate, that means 8,000 samples/second for capturing voice. And for each sample, it has to be converted. Each sample is an analog value; so that value has to be converted to a digital signal, an 8 bit digital signal, which is called PCM ? pulse coded modulation. That means there are 256 different levels that this is distributing, which is very fine. Our amplitude of voice if you divide it into 256 parts we are making a very fine distinction; that gives you 8 bits per sample 8,000 samples/second; that comes to 64,000 bits per/second. This is a very basic rate and this rate has got a name; we will go to these names later on. A number of such channels may be multiplexed together. This 64,000 bits/second is a very basic rate. A number of such channels may be grouped together to form one particular higher level channel and different higher lever channels may again join together to make a hierarchy of channels, this is what is shown over here. (Refer slide time: 27:41 - 28:38)


These T1 etc., don?t  bother about this figure at this moment because we will look at this later on. So T1 is one particular rate at which some of these signals come. There are world wide standards actually there are two standards, we will talk about it later on. Standards of the rate at which these signals come; they sort of join together and form a stream of T2 stream and different T2 streams, different waves have different names like T1, T2, T3, etc., will form a T3 kind of frame and as you can see that the bandwidth is increasing all the time. The T1 rate is 1.544 Mb/second.  (Refer slide time: 28:38 - 32:10)

Time division multiplexing used for digital signals or analog signals carrying digital data, data rate of transmission media exceeds data rate of signals; so this has to be there otherwise your TDM system will not work. Because in that small burst of time which is given to a particular user, in that burst of time that user should be able to send whatever digital data it had accumulated during that time, as well as the previous epoch during which it was quiescent; because at that time it was other people?s turn. It may be a buffer or kind of thing where all these bits are getting accumulated and when it gets its small burst of time, during that burst of time it sends all the bits in that buffer, to make it empty. And then it becomes quite again, so it will accumulate the bits again in the buffer and then again when it gets the next burst of time it will send all the bits. Thus data rate of transmission media has to exceed data rate of signals. It uses a frame; frame means a number of bits and bytes put together to form one particular unit at which to send it over; one slot for each slice of time. What would happen is that a slow device during his slot will send a lower number of bits; very high-speed device will send a large number of bits, but your  slot will come periodically. One or more slots of each device is equal to channel and time slots are transmitted whether source has data or not. This is one particular problem with time division multiplexing. Think about this ? that on the receiving side, receiver side is blind; it does not know this stream of bits which has come is for whom. The only way he knows that this is the time slot for receiver I, so he will send those bits to receiver I and so on in a round robin fashion. What happens is, suppose the  senders are S1, S2 to Sn, receivers are also S1, S2 to Sn; and then we have this. The SI will be sending to RI; what happens if SI has nothing to send at that point of time? During that time it is not possible for the multiplexer or the demultiplexer, in the normal scheme of things, to send somebody else maybe Sj?s signal during that time although physically it would be possible; but then on the demultiplexing side it would cause a problem because the demultiplexer would not know whether this bit is for Ri or Rj. That is why even if Si has nothing to send, that slot will have to run empty; you can not utilize it any further. This is the weakness of time division multiplexing which we try to sort of address in a different scheme, we will be talking about just now. (Refer slide time: 32:11 - 32:33)

The synchronous time division multiplexing, remember that it is synchronous because the multiplexer and the demultiplexer has to agree about the slot of time; the original time division multiplexing, the multiplexer accepts input from attached devices in a round robin fashion and transmit. T1 and ISDN telephone lines are common examples of synchronous time division multiplexing. (Refer slide time: 32:34 - 33:01)


If one device generates data at a faster rate than other devices, then the multiplexer must either sample the incoming data stream from that device more often than it samples the other devices or buffer the faster incoming stream. If a device has nothing to transmit the multiplexer must still insert a piece of data from that device into the multiplexed stream, it may be a dummy data. (Refer slide time: 33:02 - 34:08)

Before I talk about the other kind of TDM, which is the statistical time division multiplexing, I must mention that there are hybrid multiplexing schemes also. That means in the hybrid scheme, what you do is that you take a frequency band; it is like frequency division multiplexing, so you break up your entire available channels into a number of bands; but each of the bands instead of in the pure FDM, we are giving it to only one user but this band is allotted to may be a number of users who use TDM on this band. This is a combination of FDM and TDM, so such kind of hybrid multiplexing systems are quite widely used in these days and one good example is the cell phone communication that goes on; that may use hybrid kind of multiplexing systems. (Refer slide time: 34:10 - 34:21)

In hybrid multiplexing system, both FDM and TDM may be combined; the available channel is broken up into frequency bands; in each band multiple channels are accommodated through TDM. (Refer slide time: 34:22 - 36:38)


Now we talk about the other kind of  time division multiplexing, namely, statistical multiplexing. This is time division but on demand rather than fixed, so we reschedule link on a per packet basis and packets from different sources are interweaved on the link. Remember that I mentioned the disadvantage of time division multiplexing is that even if the sender does not have to send anything, that time slot will go empty. We cannot utilize it because otherwise on the demultiplexer side we will not be able to decipher who it is in the pure time division multiplexing. This is to be addressed in statistical time division multiplexing or STDM; what is done is that the packets are sent on demand; that means if somebody has to send and the channel is free, it will be sent. Of course if everybody has to send, then you have to once again do some kind of scheduling in a round robin fashion in a simple vanilla case or you can do more fancy kind of scheduling. I am not going into that. So this utilizes the channel in a much more efficient manner; but you have a problem. We know what the problem is ? the problem is on the demultiplexer side. On the demultiplexer side, one particular time slot being allotted to one particular sender or a receiver, that relationship is no longer there, and if that relationship is no longer there, how do we make out on the other side whether this is meant for whom? So you have to have that address inside that data stream. That means inside the data stream, there must be something which tells the receiver and the demultiplexer that this is meant for that receiver.  So you have to have the address, at least the destination address in the packet so to say, now I am calling it a packet that what ever the burst of data sent in a particular time slot. 
 (Refer slide time: 36:41 - 38:20)

It allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit. How is this possible? This is because usually our communication is always bursting, for example, when I am talking I may require 4 kHz, when I am making a sound;  but then there are periods when I am quiescent that means I?m not talking at all .So overall if I can utilize that, maybe my effective rate of utilization of the channel will become more than 4 kHz; because one user is using 4 kHz. And this way in each of the channels, the same thing happens and much more dramatically, in the world of sending and receiving data. Data traffic is inherently bursting, which means that one computer is communicating with other computer, this will do so in bursts. It will want to send a lot of stuff; suddenly it has something to send, so it will want to send it fast in a burst. Then for a long time it will be quiet, as there will be nothing because it will go there, maybe get processed over there, maybe some user sees it, sees that data, and things like that. So it is quiet for a long time, then again it sends another burst. And in-between these bursts there is a lot of time. While the burst is there, I am using at a very high speed but then other people can share it, so that is why in some sense it allows connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit. (Refer slide time: 38:21 - 39:00)

This works on the premise that not all nodes will transmit at full capacity at all times; must transmit a terminal identification, as I said the destination identification has to be there; and may require storage because two different sources may want to send at the same time and both of them land up hoping that the channel will be free. I am calling it a multiplexer at this point, at the multiplexer end you have to store them and then forward them over the channels, and then the channel becomes available. (Refer slide time: 39:01 - 39:56)

This is a picture of once again getting multiplexed ? they are getting multiplexed as they come. This is the queue in-between and you have this buffer over here, this is the memory where the incoming packets are getting stored and they are making a queue so there are a number of packets here and from this queue one by one as they come, it is not necessary that they have to go in a strict round robin fashion; as they arrive they have are being pumped into this transmission channel. On this side, on the demultiplexing side, it will look at some receiver address which is contained within this packet or cell, whatever it is, and then send it to the proper receiver. (Refer slide time: 39:57 - 40:47)

The buffer packets that are contending for the link, the packet queue may be processed first in and out, but as I said this is the most vanilla kind of scheme; there are other fancy schemes. For example you may have a high-priority queue for some of the users who may be paying more ? that queue is processed first before the other queues and all kinds of possibilities are there. But of course since you have a buffer, it is theoretically possible and since your capacity of the link cannot handle if all the senders decide to send at the same time, which may happen, in which case it will be filling it in the buffer, but the buffer may also overflow, which means that there is a congestion in the network and then some data loss is there.
(Refer slide time: 40:48 - 41:16)

To summarize, a statistical multiplexer transmits only the data from active work stations. If a work station is not active, no space is wasted on the multiplexed stream; a statistical multiplexer accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame containing only the data to be transmitted and also as I said this frame will also contain the some kind of destination address. (Refer slide time: - 41:16 - 45:41) 


This is an example to identify each piece of data and the address is included. So the data of c as well as address of c, data of a as well as address of a ? the address also has to go with the data. This of course is under the assumption that all these data packets and these addresses, together all these packet lengths are fixed, which is the case in some systems like ATM, etc. The size is fixed but the size may vary also, if the size varies then you will have to include the length of a also, that means this is the data of a; what is the total length of a or maybe the data part, if this part is fixed depending on the scheme then the address to which this is destined. All these are put in the form of a frame and then it is sent. Finally I would like to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each of the schemes. By the way, in the beginning I mentioned something called code division multiplexing, which is a very interesting scheme. We will talk about code division multiplexing when we talk about multiple access. There are actually two terms; one is multiplexing and the other is multiple access. Usually this is how we mean it but distinction is getting blurred these days; usually when you are multiplexing, the sources are sort of converged to the multiplexer in some sense. The sources are converged to the multiplexer in some sense and  it goes to the demultiplexer where it diverges. There is a specific convergence which is there, that means a number of telephone lines are getting multiplexed; a number of telephone lines will come to the local telephone exchange. There these may be all destined for some other exchange, so all these lines will be multiplexed together so they are happening physically in one place. If the problem is this, then once again you have a shared medium but the users are distributed. In that case we call it a multiple access system. CDMA is a multiple access system as well as you can in some sense call it a multiplexing system also. As I said this distinction is slowly getting blurred these days; for example, you are doing some kind of multiplexing  when you come to cell phones. We are doing some hybrid kind of multiplexing; that means we have got a combination of FDM and TDM; i.e., we have some bands of frequencies which are being used by a number of users; but these users are not at the same place. They are carrying some wireless station. That means they are carrying their mobile handsets and are at various locations. Even for the same base station, under the same base station, they are at various locations in that area so to say. Thus the distinction between multiplexing and multiple access is getting a little blurred these days. Anyway we will discuss code division multiplexing or multiple access when we talk about other kinds of multiple access. As you can guess, there is time division multiple access and then there is frequency division multiple access and then of course this code division multiple access is also there; so we will discuss it there. (Refer slide time: 45:43 - 48:20)

Coming back to the scheme that we discussed, namely, FDM, what are the advantages and good things about each of these schemes? FDM is of course simple and being simple means that it is cheap and is very popular, and as I mentioned this is the oldest multiplexing technique. Your radio uses this and lots of other systems use this. TDM is specifically for digital signals, so for digital signals TDM is very nice and then you can have a multiplexing hierarchy; that is another advantage of TDM. Why it is an advantage? Well the advantage is because of this: at different places we may require different levels of bandwidth and speed. Just think about this ? suppose we have this telephone network, you may have a small exchange; the small exchange will naturally have a small number of users and only a few of those users will want to communicate or make an STD call or to communicate with some other telephone, which is under some other exchange. So the few will have to be multiplexed together at the small exchange and it will be sent to the trunk exchange and from there it may go to another trunk exchange and so on and finally reach. At the trunk exchange what is happening is that once again various such connections from different local exchanges are coming and converging to the same trunk exchange. When this trunk exchange is communicating with another big trunk exchange, what is happening is that there are a lot of tributaries flowing into it, there are a lot of channels. So basically in the same signal, we are doing time division multiplexing. That means the rate at which the receiver at this end is sending, that same rate has to be maintained throughout; but then instead of flowing in small tributaries, it is moved into a very fat channel. We require a multiplexing hierarchy. So such multiplexing hierarchies are easy to implement using time division multiplexing; we will see more of this when we talk about synchronous digital hierarchy later on. (Refer slide time: 48:21 - 50:47)

STDM?s advantages: we are only talking about advantages. We will talk about disadvantages later on. In statistical time division multiplexing, this has certainly more efficient bandwidth use. It  is much more efficient because as I mentioned, that specially data usage and usage in general may be very bursty and if it is bursty, then during the quiescent period, ordinary TDM is just wasting the channel whereas STDM is making full use of it. So it has more efficient bandwidth use; that is a good thing about STDM. Another advantage of STDM is that the frame can contain control information; since you are putting a frame, may be with the address of the receiver or may be other kinds of control information can be put in the frame. And then, the packets can be of varying sizes. These are the advantages of STDM; not all STDM systems will allow this varying sizes; for example, ATM will not allow varying size cells. In ATM, the packets are called cells, they will have a fixed size but some systems may allow. WDM: we are writing it separately because although as I said this is some form of FDM, this works with a very high capacity, is scalable, and this has got low noise sensitivity. That is another good thing about the communication in the optical domain. Suppose you are doing it in a electrical domain through a wire, may be, if there is some kind of electrical noise, somewhere some motor has started or very bad if there is some lightning somewhere nearby, lot of noise will get into it and this electrical wire will catch all this noise. Whereas an optical fiber is not going to catch any of these noises, it is very immune to noise, which is why it?s got a very low noise sensitivity, which is very good and very high capacity and you can scale it to still higher capacity using DWDM. 
(Refer slide time: 50:48 - 51:20)

Just a quick look at the disadvantages: FDM, as I mentioned earlier, is susceptible to noise, wasted bandwidth, because of this guard band, etc., and of course one frequency is whatever the small band is being permanently given to one user and if his usage is very bursty, then a lot of bandwidth is wasted. Then, we have a limited frequency range. In TDM we have wasted bandwidth for the same reason. (Refer slide time: 51:21 - 52:06) 

STDM takes care of that problem in a TDM but this is very expensive; traditionally we did not have any other alternative so we used STDM a lot when high speed was necessary especially in the service provider side, we used STDM. WDM is somewhat more costly than TDM and FDM but since this is a developing technology, this cost is coming down and that means the WDM cost is coming down but it is still somewhat more costly than TDM and FDM but may be less costly than STDM. We have looked at the different multiplexing techniques today; in the next lecture we will look at one kind of network, which is very widely used for data and all kinds of communication, namely, the telecom network, the telecommunication network. Because remember that although it is called telecommunication network and it was traditionally for people talking over telephones, for voice, etc., that is the network which carries most of the wide area data traffic today, and that is a very important. We will talk about it in the next lecture.

Today we will talk about telecom networks, means the kind of network that is used by telephones and of course it is by host of other things as we will discuss. This telecom network is very important in the sense that first of all, it is one of the earliest network that we had and that is one thing that is quite old and secondly, the telecom network even today is mostly used for a wide area communication. Comparatively, we have much fewer, I mean entirely or exclusive data networks. We will look at the evolution of telecom networks.(Refer slide time:53:54-55:29)

Well when Alexander Graham Bell developed the first telephone, it was a couple of telephone instruments connected by wire. Now if you are trying to connect more than one people that means more than one subscribers are there; taking this principle forward you will have to connect everybody to everybody else through a wire which of course becomes very unwieldy very soon; because connecting or stringing a wire between every pair of telephones, that might want to communicate was not a good long term strategy at all. As you can see that very soon we?ll have veritable jungle of wires and of course its costly and it is very difficult to manage. At the subscriber end you cannot handle so many wires coming into your premise, so better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office. There an operator could connect one telephone to another via switchboard. That is the next figure, you see that the number of wires have come down. As a matter of fact in the figure at the top if you have n subscribers, naturally you have n(n -1) / 2 links which is approximately n2 kind of links. Whereas in the latter case you have only n links so the number of links as n becomes large, and you know today there are so many telephone subscribers so there is no question of connecting them individually, you have to connect them to a central switching office.(Refer slide time:55:46-56:59)

Even then once, again I mentioned this earlier in the lecturer, you must remember that it is not that we have a whole parallel network for data from computers etc. all over the globe, it is not there. The telecom network has been around for a long time. It had a long and very excellent history so that is why even today most of the wide area network traffic still rides on this telecom network. Originally it might have been a packet then it might be sort of made into some kind of  a session for which there is some part of the connection is dedicated and all kinds of technology has come in but even today most of the wide area networks are based on the telecom networks and telecom . That is one side of the story, the other side of the story is that telecom networks the telecom people are actually in the process of routing some of the voice calls and may be some of the other kinds of calls into this packet kind of technology.(Refer slide time:57:00-57:22)

So DSL at subscriber end- voice traffic is transmitted as standard analog telephony signals; data traffic is transmitted over the same line via a DSL modem that transmits the data as high frequency digital broadband signals on the same line. If you have DSL modem you can have both your voice as well as data at the same time, unlike very ordinary  analog lines. (Refer slide time:57:23-57:35)


So DSL at the central office end, CO end, and the signal passes through a splitter as I have shown and a local loop management system. The subscriber line access multiplexer is there in this figure (Refer slide time: 57:36-57:39) we have already seen (Refer slide time: 57:40-57:43)





In this figure, we have DSLAM and the loop management over there, (Refer slide time:57:44-57:59)


The broadband digital signals are directed to a DSLAM that terminates and coordinates traffic from multiple local loop lines. From the DSLAM, the traffic is sent to a router and then to the internet.  And finally we have the loop management system, (Refer slide time: 58:02-58:24)

 
which may be in front of the splitter, or behind the splitter. This comes to various  functions like giving the connections and  testing and all this service kind of testing are done through the local loop management. Thank you.
