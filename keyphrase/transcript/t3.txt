The MS-DOS FAT system is explained in Norton and Wilton [1988], and the OS/2
description can be found in Iacobucci [1988]. These operating systems use
the Intel 8086 CPUs(Intel [1985b ], Intel [1985a], Intel [1986], and Intel [1990]).
IBM allocation methods are described in Deitel [1990]. The internals of the
BSD UNL'   system are covered in full in McKusick et al. [1996]. McVoy and
Kleiman [1991] discusses optimizations of these methods made in Solaris. The
Coogle file system is described in Ghemawat et al. [2003]. FUSE can be found
at http:/ /fuse.sourceforge.net/.
Disk file allocation based on the buddy system is covered in Koch
[1987]. A file-organization scheme that guarantees retrieval in one access
is described by Larson and Kajla [1984]. Log-structured file organizations
for enhancing both performance and consistency are discussed in
Rosenblum and Ousterhout [1991], Seltzer et al. [1993], and Seltzer et aL
[1995]. Algorithms such as balanced trees (and much more) are covered
by Knuth [1998] and Carmen et aL [2001]. The ZFS source code for space
maps can be found at http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnvgate/
usr I src/uts/ common/ fs/ zfs/ space_map.c.
Disk caching is discussed by McKeon [1985] and Smith [1985]. Caching in
the experimental Sprite operating system is described in Nelson et aL [1988].
General discussions concerning mass-storage technology are offered by Chi
[1982] and Hoagland [1985]. Folk and Zoellick [1987] covers the gamut of file
structures. Silvers [2000] discusses implementing the page cache in the NetBSD
operating system.
The network file system (NFS) is discussed in Sandberg et aL [1985],
Sandberg [1987], Sun [1990], and Callaghan [2000]. NFS Version 4 is a standard
described at http:/ /www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt. The characteristics of
503
workloads in distributed file systems are examined in Baker et al. [1991].
Ousterhout [1991] discusses the role of distributed state in networked file
systems. Log-structured designs for networked file systems are proposed in
Hartman and Ousterhout [1995] and Thekkath et al. [1997]. NFS and the UNIX
file system (UFS) are described in Vahalia [1996] and Mauro and McDougall
[2007]. The Windows NT file system, NTFS, is explained in Solomon [1998]. The
Ext2 file system used in Linux is described in Bovet and Cesati [2002] and
the WAFL file system in Hitz et al. [1995]. ZFS documentation can be found at
http:/ /www.opensolaris.org/ os/ community /ZFS/ docs.
