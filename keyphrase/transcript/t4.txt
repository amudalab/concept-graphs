Disk file allocation based on the buddy system is covered in Koch
[1987]. A file-organization scheme that guarantees retrieval in one access
is described by Larson and Kajla [1984]. Log-structured file organizations
for enhancing both performance and consistency are discussed in
Rosenblum and Ousterhout [1991], Seltzer et al. [1993], and Seltzer et aL
[1995]. Algorithms such as balanced trees (and much more) are covered
by Knuth [1998] and Carmen et aL [2001]. The ZFS source code for space
maps can be found at http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnvgate/
