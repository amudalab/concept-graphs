Welcome to the course biochemistry one conducted by myself doctor s dasgupta of the department of chemistry iit kharagpur
In this course we will be studying certain aspects of biochemistry starting from structures and functions of bio molecules right on to bioenergetics and metabolism 


The topics that we will be covering are structures and functions of biological molecules in that we will considering amino acids and proteins enzymes under enzymes will be considering the mechanisms of specific enzymes then we will go on to vitamins and coenzymes carbohydrates and lipids Nucleic acids and their components all of the topics of this course will be covered in their directory as is relevant to this course 
We then will be considering the principles of bioenergetics with special reference to carbohydrate metabolism  
The books that we will be covering are common biochemistry books such as Stryer Lehninger Voet and Voet
Apart from this there are many internet sites and websites that give us a lot of information on biology and biochemistry in general
So you could also look up those sites where there are specific course material available and specific tutorials and quiz materials also available for you to access when we consider the central dogma of biology the first thing that comes to mind is DNA
DNA is the storage medium the central dogma of biology goes like this DNA to RNA to protein 
we have a text that is comprised of DNA which is the four basis of DNA that are the storage medium this is then transcripted to RNA which is the transmission medium that also is comprised of four basis one of them being a bit different the RNA is then translated to the protein the alphabet of DNA RNA and protein is slightly different what is this alphabet 


in DNA we have four letters to the alphabet the four letters are as you can here A G T and C these are the four letters that comprise the alphabet of DNA 
if you look at the corresponding alphabet of RNA you will see that we have U C A and G 
when we go on to study the structure and contents of nucleic acids the structure of each of these basis will be much clearer but for now we have to know that DNA and RNA are comprised of these letters which are actually or which actually represent nitrogenous basis 
the protein alphabet is a bit different the protein alphabet is some times represented as a three letter code which we will see in a moment or by the one letter code which is another representation of the very same three letter code 
the protein alphabet is comprised of twenty unique letters that tell us what the protein sequence is we will understand what an amino acids sequence is once we get into the details of what is a peptide bond and what is an amino acid 
the first thing that we know or we try to understand here is the carbon atom 
now if we consider what these proteins are actually made of proteins consist of amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds we will understand this also in detail to see how a peptide bond is actually formed and how we can link these letters together  into forming what would be like a sentence 
each amino acids consists of a central carbon atom which you can see marked as  C alpha here 
so we have the central carbon atom that is marked as C alpha to it we have an amino group all of you recognize an amino group as the NH two group 
we then have the carboxyl acid group which is C O O H we also have an what is called R group 
now this R group is what is the side chain of the amino acid and we also have the hydrogen group the hydrogen atom here 
what is common to all amino acids is this part because it has an amino group it has an acid group this is white is called an amino acid it also has NH a hydrogen attached with 
so we see that this central carbon atom is actually a chiral carbon meaning that it is asymmetric which again means that there are four different groups attached to the central carbon atom and since all amino acids have a common set of groups here in the amino group the hydrogen atom and the carboxyl group what differs is this side chain which can be different atoms different groups of atoms and this is what is actually distinguishes the various amino acids 
we are now can going to consider what types of R groups we can actually have 


now if we look at that different forms of amino acids that could be incorporated into proteins as we mentioned in the previous slide we have an amino group we have an carboxyl group we have an hydrogen atom and we also have an R group attached with it 
now because of its chirality it can have an L form or a D form usually L amino acids are incorporated into proteins 
now you understand that these side chains the R group can  now differ in its size it can differ in it shape it can differ in its polarity we understand that what each of these mean  but there are twenty common amino acids which have distinctive R groups with distinct properties  of size shape and polarity 




we will consider the amino acid side chain by group in each case and what have to remember is the three letter code of the amino acid along with one letter code as well and obviously you have to remember what the side chain comprises what we have listed here is glycine and proline 
glycine and proline are unique amino acids in ways of we will see in a moment glycine is the simplest amino acid because the R group is just an hydrogen atom 



now this hydrogen atom makes the carbon central carbon atom um atom of glycine symmetric because no it does not have a four different groups attached with it has two edge atoms attached with which does not make it chirole anymore and this only such amino acid 
so if we look at the side chain of glycine where the R group is written here and we now know this  that this is where the R group is attached  this is our amino group and this is our carboxyl acid group 
now if you notice the way where we have written the amino acids we have written it with NH three plus and a  C O O minus this is because at physiological ph this OH is lost deu to pk value of the carboxylic group  which we will be doing in the subsequent class and this amino group is protonated  which means that it has an additional  hydrogen atom to it making this nitrogen positively charged this is what is called the zwitterionic form of the amino acid it is written as zwitterionic form and it is usually represented in this fashion so this is what is called a zwitterion 
it is represented in this fashion because we would like to represent the amino acids as what they would be at physiological ph 
the next unique amino acid is proline now if you notice it does not have an distinct R group attached with but the R group is actually linked up to what is called amino group here 


so the side chain is actually CH two CH two CH two but linked to the NH plus in this case so we have a C alpha with the hydrogen with the carboxylic acid here but instead of being an amino acid proline is actually what we would called an imin  acid because we do not have an amine group here we have an imine so we have an imino acid where the CH two CH two CH two benzone to itself to form proline so these are the two amino acids that are unique in their features glycine being just because it has the hydrogen atom there and it  a chiral and proline because it is an um imino acid because the side chain bends back upon itself and as I mentioned when we represent the amino acids we represent them in zwitterionic form where we write NH three plus and C O O minus because this is how they would remain in or at physiological ph in normal solution 
if we go to the next group of amino acids we consider now hydrophobic amino acids now what are hydrophobic amino acids hydrophobic amino acids are those amino acids that are comprised of mostly of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms in their side chains 
so they would tend to be a way from the solvent usually the solvent being water or water based they would be away from water so they would be hydrophobic not liking to be in water what are these specific side chains that we can have the simplest one of side chain is alanine
alanine the three letter code is Ala and the one letter code is A the side chain is a methyl group 


so this is what we would say is the R group and you recognize again the zwitterionic representation of amino acid 
we then come to valine valine is beta branched we have CH CH three CH three we then have leucine CH two CH CH three CH three
so it branched at the gama atom and the way these are represented is that if this is the C alpha the next atom is the C beta connected to the C beta or the C gama atoms which would be a unique representation of the amino acid valine 
if we look at leucine we would again have a unique representation considering that this is C alpha the next one is C beta the next one is C gama and um attached to the C gama are two C deltas one is represented as Cd one and the other as Cd two 
in the alanine side chain we would just have a C beta carbon or Cb so these code actually be represented very clearly in a unique manner where each amino acid this part being common 
the chain could be represented by the types of atoms that are attached to the c alpha if you look at isoleucine we have CH CH three CH two CH three 
so we have the two beta carbon one methyl group and one ethyl group attached with it this is isoleucine
now if you look at all the side chains that have been circled here they are comprised of carbon and hydrogen only which make them hydrophobic in nature 
methionine can fall into this category is well but  it has a sulphur atom and a methyl group attached to the sulphur atom 
so we have a C alpha we have a C beta a C gama and two to C gama is attached to the sulphur atom and then we have a methyl group attached to the sulphur 
methionine a long with another amino acid which we will consider in a moment cysteine are the two sulphur containing amino acids and they could be grouped together in a group of their own or they could be consider in this group is well 
the next group that we will be considering are the polar amino acids now what we mean by polar amino acids are those that have an oxygen or a nitrogen um atom in their side chain and then by virtue of having the oxygen and nitrogen in the side chain these hetero atoms they can participate in polar interactions not only among themselves but also within or with a solvent molecules 
so they can participate in what we call hydrogen bonding which is extremely important in non covalent interactions in proteins which is what hold a protein fold it together the protein chain the amino acid chain 


we will see that in subsequent classes but the polar amino acids are once that are likely to interact with the solvent and this interaction they can allow the oxygen and nitrogen atoms they are comprised of  two interact with the solvent or within themselves to form a network and remain in solvent 
in contrast the hydrophobic amino acid are unlikely to be on the surface of the protein
so when we have an globally structure which we will see in subsequent classes we will see that they are certain side chains are preferred to be on the surface of the protein and there are certain side chains that are preferred to be away from the solvent which we have seen in the previous slide would be the once at a  hydrophobic in nature 
now if you go back to look at side chains that comprise this polar group of amino acids what we have here is each of these have an oxygen or hydrogen attached with it 
we have of course the common part of each amino acid the asparagine side chain in the asparagine side chain and the glutamine side chain this been the common part again 
we have amide groups amide groups are C double bond O NH two groups so this comprises the amide of asparagine this comprises the amide of glutamine the difference is that the glutamine chain is one carbon longer then the asparagine chain 
so what we have here is we have a CH two that is the beta carbon attached to the alpha carbon followed by a gama carbon that has attached with an oxygen atom and then NH two 
so this amide group has a single beta I mean carbon attached to the c alpha in glutamine we have two CH two moiety is here we have a C alpha a C beta a C gama a C delta and to it is attached to a C double bond O if NH two and the oxygen and the nitrogen so what can actually happen is this oxygen and nitrogen similarly in glutamine can participate in what is hydrogen bonding meaning that if we have a specific donor or an acceptor then this could participate in hydrogen bonding not only with other amino acids but also with the solvent 
if we look at serine serine is a small amino acid but a polar amino acid the group that it has is CH two OH and it is this OH that can participate in hydrogen bonding 
threamine is next amino acid it has attached to the beta carbon a CH three and an OH so again it differs from serine you see how each of these are unique in their own way 
the next amino acid is cysteine cysteine is another of the amino acid that has with it a sulphur atom that other one that me saw on the previous um slide was methionine that also has a sulphur atom but to the sulphur was attached a methyl group here we have a hydrogen atom making this a ethyl so we have a CH two SH 
this is a Histidine Histidine is a very important amino acid which we will be  we will come across a lot when we consider the enzymes and the enzyme mechanisms because of its specific polarity or specific properties of this side chain that is an amidazole group so again we have a common amino acid part here in histidine we have two nitrogens in the side chain for that is part of the amidazole protein 
so what you can see in this polar group of amino acids is all side chains that belong to this group contained what is called a hetero atom 
the next group of side chains that we will be considering is Acidic Amino Acids we looked at asparagine and glutamine in a previous slide 


what we found in the aspargine was the C double bond NH two now we know that an amide comes from a carboxylic acid so the asparagine comes from a specific carboxylic acid similarly glutamine also comes from a carboxylic acid so we group them into what are called Acidic Amino Acids and we call the specific acids aspartic acid which gives rise to a asparagine and glutamic acid which gives rise to glutamine 
now what we have here is a C double bond O O minus now this is apart from the actual carboxylic acid that comprises the part that is common to all amino acids this is part of the R group the side chain 
so the side chain in this case also contains a C double bond O O minus similarly the side chain and glutamic acid also has the C O O O minus that again we have an additional CH two in case of glutamic acid just like we had for glutamine 
no what we have written here in addition is what is called a pKa value we will learn more about this in our next class 
but just for a preliminary information if the pKa value is less than the ph of your solution then your carboxylic acid is going to lose the proton  
similarly this has lose its proton but this has not what does this mean it means that pKa value of this amino group is actually higher than physiological pH which is why it has still kept its proton attached with it okay 
but the pK if we consider the physiological pH to be “seven point four” it means pKa of this group is greater than “seven point four” and we will see how it is actually something close to nine between nine and ten 
so if we have the pK value greater than “seven point four” this is going to remain protonated but these carboxylic acid cannot remain protonated so these comprised what are known as Acidic Amino Acids 
if there Acidic Amino Acids it means that there are also be a basic amino acids so what are these basic amino acids these are like lysine and arginine



Considering lysine and arginine let us look at the groups now what are the side chains this is the long side chain of lysine and this is the side chain of asparagine 
Now if you look carefully at the side chains here there are two pKa values written what are these pKa values these pKa values are actually greater than the pH physiological pH which is why they are still protonated  so we have protonated nitrogens because the physiological pH is “seven point four” and we have not reached the pKa value where this is going to lose its proton a pKa value where it is going to lose the proton which as I said we will discuss in our subsequent classes
So apart from the common part  amino group that we have here we have an additional amino group here because it is a basic amino acid
In arginine we have what is called  a guanidinium group here that is part of the side chain it has a nitrogen here a nitrogen here and a nitrogen here so this is a lysine and this is a  arginine and because of their properties a specially the acidic and basic amino acid residues these are the residues preferred to be on the surface of the protein 
So if we look at the different structures of the amino acids that we consider we have specific groupings the groupings are the polar amino acids so we have in a group by itself glycine and proline because of the uniqueness in their properties we have also our polar amino acids we have hydrophobic amino acids we have acidic amino acids and we have basic amino acids 
Now there is another group of amino acids called the aromatic amino acids now the aromatic amino acids are unique as you can see the name itself such as their property they are aromatic in naoure under these we have three amino acids phenylalanine tyrocine and tryptophan 



So let us look at the side chains these are the aromatic amino acids we have phenylalanine if you remember what alanine was it was just a methyl group attached to the C alpha in this case one hydrogen has been replaced by a phenyl group so its name is phenylalanine we of course have the common part of the amino acid here the three letter code for phenylalanine is Phe and the one letter code is F 



so we have a phenyl group replacing one hydrogen of alanine phenylalanine so this is aromatic in nature we have tyrosine which is similarly similar to phenylalanine the only difference being that this hydrogen is replaced by an OH so the tyrosine can actually also be involved in hydrogen bonding in the grouping of amino acids this could also therefore be put into a polar group but it is already grouped under the aromatic amino acids because of the phenyl ring here 
so we have a CH two and we have a phenyl and an OH attached to this which is called tyrosine 
in tryptophan we have an indole ring attached to this CH two this is a very bulky amino acid as you can see by the shear size of it and it is quite rare in proteins in that it is not present to a very large extent in many proteins 
the unique properties of these aromatic amino acids which make the protein useful in an analytical way is all the aromatic amino acids that we have considered the aromatic amino acids which are as I wrote previously phenylalanine tyrocine and tryptophan each of this absorb uvv light they absorb ultra violet light 
so their presence in proteins can actually be neutralized in this fashion what do we mean by that they absorb uv light in the range they have different lamba max values but usually we look at two eight nano meters to identify a protein 
so if we have a solution that has a certain amount of protein in it we can actually determine the amount of protein present in the solution by a consideration of the number of phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan that are present in the protein chain 


 so if we monitor or we find out the absorbance at two eighty nano meter we know what is called the extension of our protein and we know  the length of the cell we know extension coefficient of the protein and we know what the absorbance is at two eighty nano meter which is also represented as A two eighty we can determine the concentration of the protein so what we have is the presence of these aromatic amino acids help us in determining whether our solution actually contains protein or not and we can also find out the content of the concentration of the protein in solution by virtue of their having phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan of these tryptophan has the highest extension which means that if you have a large number of tryptophan amino acids in the protein you are going to have a larger absorbance at two eighty nano meters 
but the presence of the aromatic amino acids themselves will give an absorbance at two eighty nano meters which is how proteins are monitored in biochemistry laboratories 
the next scene we are going to look into is a representation when we consider a representation of amino acids as we have already seen we have a carboxyl group we have a amino group we have a hydrogen atom which is common to all amino acids and we have a side chain of R now if you look at this side chain you recognize that this is an amide group 



the two amide groups were asparagine and glutamine the glutamine side chain had two CH two groups so we have two CH two groups attached here this is what is called a stick representation which we will look at in the next class where we have the asymmetric carbon in green  the others in grey nitrogens in blue oxygens in red and the other carbons atoms in grey 
if we look at now  the linking of these amino acids because we know that when we going to form proteins these are actually the building blocks of proteins now these building blocks have to be linked together how are they linked together they are linked together by what is called a peptide bond 
now if you look at representation here that we have shown on the left here this is not an zwitterionic representation because the proton of the carboxylic group is attached with it and this is the NH two group in actual form it would remain as NH three plus and C O O minus but what we have here is we have two R groups now how do we have two R groups in the first amino acid that we have on the left hand side we have what is called an amino terminal so this is what is called a di peptide because we have two amino acids linked by a peptide bond
in this linkage which is out peptide linkage  we have a C double bond O and an NH 
but if we look at a original amino acid we are missing an OH from the carboxylic acid side and we are missing NH from the amino side what is that make it makes H two O so when we are linking to two amino acids by the elimination of H two O we can form a peptide bond 
we will look into the features of the peptide bond once we considered the protein structure in general and the amino acid sequence  but what we have to remember here is that when these amino acids are linked together on the left hand you always have the n terminus  and on the right hand side you always have the C terminus because this is the way the proteins are formed where this is the way they are synthesized 
so we have an amino terminal and we have a carboxylic acid terminal and the first amino acid is the one that always has the NH three plus attached with and the last amino acid in a protein sequence or in a protein chain is the one that has the C O O minus attached with  
so this is what we have a di peptide linked by a peptide bond there are certain features of the peptide bond unique to protein structure and peptide bonds that  we will study in later classes 



so what do we essentially have in this case we have say glycine now what is happen to this glycine in this case we have a representation in zwitterionic form the glycine is one where we have if you remember from R representation of the amino acids we have an R group that is H 
here we have an R group that is CH three in in cysteine we have an R group that is CH two SH 
so these are for glycine we can actually we actually cannot distinguish which is the R group because the hydrogen is present and the hydrogen is also the side chain so we have an NH three plus we have a COO and here we are now forming and for eliminating water into forming a C double dong ONH 
so this is what has been formed this should not be there so we have a C double bond ONH a C double bond ONH 
so in the formation of a tri peptide we have glycine alanine cysteine se can go on to form other peptide linkages 
so what we can have is if we look at the basic structure of the amino acid we have a C alpha we have and NH three plus we have a  COO minus we have an H and we have attached to this and R one group 
if we now link another amino acid so you would have another NH three plus that would be long to our second amino acid we have R COO minus and we have a H and we have R R two 
so now when we combine these two amino acids to form what is called a dipeptide we would have linked these by a peptide bond and we would have R  C double bond O the NH coming from the second amino acid the C alpha the R two the H and the COO minus so this is what is our peptide linkage this particular linkage is known as the peptide linkage 
what do we have we have linked now R one and R two now in a representation of a protein it is not very convenient to keep on writing all the atoms together we know that in the protein sequence in the primary amino acid sequence the proteins are or the amino acids the building blocks are linked together by the peptide bonds 


now since they are just linked by the peptide bonds then it is not necessary to write what is common to all the amino acids because these are certain features that we already know so instead of writing in each case the NH three plus or COO minus we also know that the first amino acid is going to be linked with the NH three plus terminal and we know that the last one is going to be linked with the COO minus so it is sufficient to write instead of writing this in a laborate fashion 
when we write a protein sequence as we will see later to write what is called a protein sequence all the information we actually need is what is R one  and what is R two because we know that each amino acid looks the same it is the only difference that we have in the R book 
so if we just know that what R one and R two are when we have our protein sequence we no need to know how they are linked together so if this is amino acid one this is amino acid two I know that this has to have the NH three attached with it three four so on and say to hundred and twenty I know that this has to have the COO minus attached with and I also know that  these linkages are nothing but peptide bonds so if this is the information that I know I just need to know what R one is what R two is what R three is what R four is so on and so fourth 
this is why we just write either the three letter code or the one letter code in the three letter code if this first one were a glycine I would write gly linked with say Ala alanine linked with um acidic amino acid asparatic acid linked with a basic amino acid lysine and so on and so fourth because now when I have glycine and alanine and asparatic acid I know what are the rest of the atoms are because I know the side chain of the glycine I know the side chain of the alanine and so on and so fourth 
if I write this in a one letter code it would be G A D K so I just wrote GADK you could write those structure of this tetra peptide 


similarly when we consider a whole protein chain in this case say just hundred and twenty amino acids people consider the whole protein chain so the difference is we actually look at are in the properties of the amino acids side chains 
what is so important first is the size and shape of the amino acid that is extremely important in its accommodation how it is going to be accommodated in the  protein we look at the charge on the protein is that acidic is it basic we look at the polarity can it be involved in hydrogen bonding is it a polar amino acid hydrophobicity where is this amino acid likely to be located is it going to be located in the centre of the protein because its likes to be away from the solvent or is it going to be likely to be on the surface of the protein but we know that any hydrophobic amino acid would prefer to be in the core of the protein 
aromaticity is the aromatic amino acids that we considered phenylalanine  tyrosine tryptophan these are important in imparting uv properties to amino acids because these are the one set of absorb uv light  and because of that the absorption of uv light proteins can be detected in solution due to the presence of the aromatic amino acid and from what is knows as the beer lambert’s law we can find out the concentration of the proteins provided we know what the extension coefficient is 


the confirmation now the confirmation as we looked at that is obviously usually determined by the side chain we will see six most of the side chains are linked by the single bonds we will see how rotation about the side chains can actually  bring about conformational changes to the amino acid orientations in the proteins and this change in confirmation or the change in what is known as dihederal angles will allow us to look at different properties of amino acids in the way they interact with the other amino acids we also look at the propensity to adopt a particular conformation what does it mean 
it means that if a protein were to have an amino acid that would likely form what is known as a helix of be part of a helix that is what we call the propensity is that likely to be in a helix is that likely to be in a sheet now these terms will be much more apparent will be much more clearer  as we go to our subsequent classes 
so what we actually did learn today  is the different types of amino acids the different groupings of amino acids and the important properties of the side chains of the amino acids  
we considered that the central carbon atom the asymmetric carbon atom which is also known as the alpha carbon atom has linked to it four different groups these are hydrogen atom and amino group carboxylic group and a side chain that is represented as R 
now each of the R groups there are twenty such different common amino acids the twenty common amino acids have twenty different R groups that differed largely in their properties  [noise] we have different types of amino acids the amino acids are as I said grouped into the type of R group or the type of side chain that they have attached to them  we have unique amino acids glycine and proline we have hydrophobic amino acids we have polar amino acids  we have acidic and basic amino acids and we have aromatic amino acids 


some of these contain sulphur two of them methionine and cysteine there are other that have the hetero atoms in them oxygens and nitrogens and there are  others that have the side chains comprised entirely of carbon and hydrogen making them  hydrophobic in nature and lastly we look at overall properties that we can consider together the size the shape the charge the polarity the hydrophobicity the aromaticity and all of these will actually determine what the property of the protein is in general because we know that these amino acids are linked by peptide bonds in the linkage of the peptide bonds bringing different types of amino acids together to form a protein sequence are amino acid sequence which we study in um classes later on where we  will be looking protein structures in detail we looked at the peptide bond and we saw how the amino acids were linked together by the peptide bond and how we can actually represent the protein sequence by just writing either the three letter code one after the other or the one letter code one after the other  because we know that the first amino acid  is going to be the end terminus and the last amino acid is going to be C terminus which means that first amino acid is going to have the NH three plus attached with it and the last amino acid is going to have the COO minus attached to it making up the protein chain 
we will learn in the later classes how the protein actually folds and how the hydrophobic amino acids  tend to remain in the centre of the protein 
thank you
