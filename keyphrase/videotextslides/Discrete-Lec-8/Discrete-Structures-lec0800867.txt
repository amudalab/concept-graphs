Row 2::Height 1::forms
Row 3::Height 1::we first define formulas which are called
Row 4::Height 1::max for given number of variables the
Row 5::Height 1::ma consists of disjunctions in which each
Row 6::Height 1::variable or its negation but not both appears only
Row 7::Height 1::once
Row 8::Height 1::for a given formula an equivalent formula
Row 9::Height 1::consisting of junctions of the maxterms only is
Row 10::Height 1::known as its principal conductive normal form
Row 11::Height 1::this is also called product of sums canonical form
