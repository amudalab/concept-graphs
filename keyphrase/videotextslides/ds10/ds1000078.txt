Row 1::Height 3::quick sort the principle
Row 2::Height 3::to understand quick sort lets look at a
Row 3::Height 1::high-level description of the algorithm
Row 4::Height 1::a divide and conquer algorithm
Row 5::Height 1::divide: partition array into 2 subarrays such
Row 6::Height 1::that elements in the lower part <= elements in
Row 7::Height 1::the higher part
Row 8::Height 1::conquer: recursively sort the 2 subarrays
Row 9::Height 1::combine: trivial since sorting is done in place
