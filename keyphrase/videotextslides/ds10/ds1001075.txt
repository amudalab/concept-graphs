Row 1::Height 2::randomized quicksort
Row 2::Height 1::assume all elements are distinct
Row 3::Height 1::partition around a random element
Row 4::Height 1::consequently all splits(1:n-1, 1:n-2, ..., n-)
Row 5::Height 1::1:1)are equally likely with probability  1(n
Row 6::Height 1::randomization is a general tool to improve
Row 7::Height 1::algorithms with bad worst-case but good
Row 8::Height 1::average-case complexity
