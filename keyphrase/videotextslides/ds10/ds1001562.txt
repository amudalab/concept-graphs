Row 1::Height 2::what does expected running time mean?
Row 2::Height 1::the running time of quicksort does not depend
Row 3::Height 1::on the input. it depends on the random numbers
Row 4::Height 1::provided by the generator
Row 5::Height 1::thus for the same input the program might take
Row 6::Height 1::3sec today and 5sec tomorrow.
Row 7::Height 1::the average time taken over many different runs
Row 8::Height 1::of the program would give us the expected time
Row 9::Height 1::same as saying that we are taking average over
Row 10::Height 1::all possible random number sequences provided
Row 11::Height 1::by the generator
