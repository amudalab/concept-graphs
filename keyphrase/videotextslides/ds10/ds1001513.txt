Row 2::Height 1::randomized ouicksort analysis (2)
Row 3::Height 1::we have seen this recurrence before.
Row 4::Height 1::it is the recurrence for the expected
Row 5::Height 1::number of comparisons required to insert
Row 6::Height 1::a randomly chosen permutation of n elements
Row 7::Height 1::we proved that t(n)=o(nlog2n)
Row 8::Height 1::hence exepected number of comparisons
Row 10::Height 1::required by randomized quicksort is
Row 11::Height 1::o(nlog2n)
