Row 1::Height 2::one pass algorithms
Row 2::Height 1::one pass algorithms are applicable only
Row 3::Height 1::when one of the relation fits completely into
Row 4::Height 1::memory
Row 5::Height 1::in addition there is enough memory to store
Row 6::Height 1::at least one block of the other relation
Row 7::Height 1::hence if m memory buffers are available
Row 8::Height 1::then one of the relations should have a
Row 9::Height 1::maximum size of m-1
