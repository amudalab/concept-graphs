Row 1::Height 3::amino acids and proteins
Row 2::Height 3::proteins consist of amino acids linked by
Row 3::Height 1::peptide bonds
Row 5::Height 3::each amino acid consists of
Row 6::Height 3::a central carbon atom
Row 7::Height 3::an amino group
Row 8::Height 1::a carbonyl group and
Row 9::Height 1::a side chain
Row 10::Height 1::differences in side chains distinguish the
Row 11::Height 3::various amino acids
