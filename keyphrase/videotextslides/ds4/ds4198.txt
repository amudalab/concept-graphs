Row 1::Height 2::running time of binary search
Row 2::Height 1::the range of candidate items to be searched is
Row 3::Height 1::halved after each comparison
Row 4::Height 1::in the array-based implementation, access by
Row 5::Height 1::rank takes o(1) time, thus binary search runs in
Row 6::Height 1::o(log n) time
