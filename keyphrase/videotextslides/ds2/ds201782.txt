Row 1::Height 2::performance of the tight strategy
Row 2::Height 1::in phase the array has size
Row 3::Height 1::total cost ot phase i is
Row 4::Height 1::is the cost of creating the array
Row 5::Height 1::is the cost of copying elements into new array
Row 6::Height 3::c is the cost of the c pushes
Row 7::Height 1::hence cost phase is 2ci
Row 8::Height 3::in each phase we do c pushes hence for
Row 9::Height 3::pushes we need n/c phases total cost ot these
Row 10::Height 1::n/c phases is
