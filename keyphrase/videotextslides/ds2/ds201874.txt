Row 1::Height 2::performance of the growth strategy
Row 2::Height 1::in phase the array has size
Row 3::Height 1::total cost of phase is
Row 4::Height 1::is the cost of creating the array
Row 5::Height 1::is the of cost of copying elements into new array
Row 6::Height 3::is the cost of pushes done in the phase
Row 7::Height 1::hence cost of phase is
Row 8::Height 3::if we do n pushes we wil have log n phases
Row 9::Height 3::total cost of n pushes
Row 10::Height 1::the growth strategy wins
