Row 2::Height 1::exceptions
Row 3::Height 1::exceptions are yet another programming
Row 4::Height 1::construct useful for handling errors when we
Row 5::Height 1::find an error or an exceptional case we just
Row 6::Height 1::throw an exception
Row 7::Height 1::as soon as the exception is thrown the flow of
Row 8::Height 1::control exits from the current method and goes to
Row 9::Height 1::where that method was caled from
Row 10::Height 1::what is the point of using exceptions we
Row 11::Height 1::can delegate upwards the responsibility of
Row 12::Height 1::handling an error delegating upwards means
Row 13::Height 1::letting the code who called current code deal
Row 14::Height 1::with the problem
