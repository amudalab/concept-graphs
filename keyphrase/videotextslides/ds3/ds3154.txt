Row 1::Height 2::doubly linked lists (2)
Row 2::Height 1::when implementing a doubly linked lists, we add
Row 3::Height 1::two special nodes at the end of the lists: the
Row 4::Height 1::header and trailer nodes
Row 5::Height 1::the header node goes before the first list element. it
Row 6::Height 1::has valid next link but a null prev link
Row 7::Height 1::the trailer node goes after the last element, it has a
Row 8::Height 1::valid prev reference but a null next reference
Row 9::Height 1::the header and trailer nodes are sentinel or
Row 10::Height 1::"dummy" nodes because they do not store
Row 11::Height 1::elements
