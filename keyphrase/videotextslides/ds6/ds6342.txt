Row 1::Height 2::no of leaves in binary tree
Row 2::Height 1::no of leaves <= 1+ no of internal nodes
Row 3::Height 1::proof by induction on no of internal nodes
Row 4::Height 1::tree with 1 node has leaf but no internal
Row 5::Height 1::node
Row 6::Height 1::assume stmt is truefor tree with k-1 internal
Row 7::Height 1::nodes.
Row 8::Height 1::a tree with k internal nodes has k, internal
Row 9::Height 3::nodes in the left sub tree and (k,k+1) internal
Row 10::Height 3::nodes in right sub tree
