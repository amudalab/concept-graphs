Row 1::Height 2::insertions and deletions
Row 2::Height 1::balanced property of index trees should
Row 3::Height 1::be maintained during insertions and
Row 4::Height 1::deletions
Row 5::Height 1::insertions and deletions are problematic
Row 6::Height 1::in multi-level index,since all index files
Row 7::Height 1::are physically sorted files
Row 8::Height 1::an approach to overcome this is to use
Row 9::Height 1::dynamic multi-level indexes
