Row 1::Height 2::operators with side effects
Row 2::Height 1::the expressions we have seen so far are free of
Row 3::Height 1::side-effects. that is, the evaluation of an
Row 4::Height 1::expression only results in a value and does not
Row 5::Height 1::change the value of any variable
Row 6::Height 1::for certain operators, the evaluation of an
Row 7::Height 1::expression containing the operator can also result
Row 8::Height 1::in a change in the value of some variable. these
Row 9::Height 1::changes are called side effects
