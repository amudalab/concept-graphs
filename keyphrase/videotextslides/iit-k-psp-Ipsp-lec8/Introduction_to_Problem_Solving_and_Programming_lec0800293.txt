Row 1::Height 2::another example
Row 2::Height 1::int x
Row 3::Height 1::float y
Row 4::Height 1::y=x=7.0/5;
Row 5::Height 1::in this example, both x znd y get the value 1
Row 6::Height 1::suppose thc assignment was x = y = 7.0/5
Row 7::Height 1::in that case, y would get value 1.4 while x would
Row 8::Height 1::get value 1
