Row 1::Height 2::type hierarchy
Row 2::Height 1::from higher to lower: long double, double,
Row 3::Height 1::float, unsigned long, long, insigned int, int
Row 4::Height 1::integer operands of type smaller than int are
Row 5::Height 1::converted to type int. thus any arithmetic
Row 6::Height 1::operator results in a type of at least int
Row 7::Height 1::thus the experssion 5/2.5 has type double and has
Row 8::Height 1::value 2.0
