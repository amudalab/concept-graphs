Row 1::Height 2::arithmetic operators
Row 2::Height 1::we are already familiar with some arthmetic
Row 3::Height 1::operators. all these operators can be
Row 4::Height 1::used with both integer and floating point
Row 5::Height 1::operands
Row 6::Height 1::note that with integer operands the / operator
Row 7::Height 1::returns only the integer part of the result (the
Row 8::Height 1::quotient) the reminder resulting from the
Row 9::Height 1::division can be obtained using the % operator
Row 10::Height 1::for example the value of the expression 5 % 2
Row 11::Height 1::would be 1
