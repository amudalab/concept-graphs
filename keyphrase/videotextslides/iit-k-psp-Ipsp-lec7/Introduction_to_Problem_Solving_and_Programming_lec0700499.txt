Row 1::Height 2::an example
Row 2::Height 1::consider the expression x - y * z/10 +3
Row 3::Height 1::the order of evaluation of the operands is *, /, -
Row 4::Height 1::+
Row 5::Height 1::the expression is thus interpreted as
Row 6::Height 1::(x - ((y*z)/10))+3
Row 7::Height 1::note that the precedence rules do not state the
Row 8::Height 1::order in which the two operands of an operator
Row 9::Height 1::will be evaluated
