Row 1::Height 2::type conversion
Row 2::Height 1::whatif the operands of an operator are of different
Row 3::Height 1::types for example what is the value and type of the
Row 4::Height 1::expression 5/2.0 ?
Row 5::Height 1::in such cases the value of the operand of the lower
Row 6::Height 1::type is promoted to that of the higher type. this is
Row 7::Height 1::called implicit type conversion
Row 8::Height 1::the higher of the two types is roughly speaking the
Row 9::Height 1::one which can store a larger set of values
Row 10::Height 1::note that if the lower type operand is a variable, this
Row 11::Height 1::operation does not change the type of the variable itself
Row 12::Height 1::only the value used in the computation of the expression
