Row 1::Height 2::building tree from post and inorder
Row 2::Height 1::in place of preorder we can use postorder
Row 3::Height 1::the last node vidited in the postorder
Row 4::Height 1::traversal is the root of the binary tree
Row 5::Height 1::this can then be used to split in the
Row 6::Height 1::inorder traversal to identify the left and
Row 7::Height 3::right sub trees
Row 8::Height 1::procedure is a similar to the one for
Row 9::Height 1::obtaining tree from preorder and inorder
Row 10::Height 1::traversals
