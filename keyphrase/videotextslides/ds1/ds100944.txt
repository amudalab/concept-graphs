Row 1::Height 2::asymptotic analysis
Row 2::Height 1::goal to simplify analysis of running time by
Row 3::Height 1::getting rid of details which may be affected by
Row 4::Height 1::specific implementation and hardware
Row 5::Height 1::like rounding
Row 6::Height 1::capturing the essence how the running time of
Row 7::Height 3::an algorithm increases with the size of the input
Row 8::Height 1::in the limit
Row 9::Height 3::asymptotically more efficient algorithms are best for
Row 10::Height 1::all but small inputs
