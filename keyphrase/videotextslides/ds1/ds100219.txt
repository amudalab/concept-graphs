Row 1::Height 2::limitations of experimental studies
Row 2::Height 1::it is necessary to implement and test the
Row 3::Height 3::algorithm in order to determine its running time
Row 4::Height 1::experiments can be done only on limited set of
Row 5::Height 1::inputs and may not be indicative of the running
Row 6::Height 1::time on other inputs not included in the
Row 7::Height 1::experiment
Row 8::Height 3::in order to compare two algorithms the same
Row 9::Height 1::hardware and software environments should be
Row 10::Height 1::used
