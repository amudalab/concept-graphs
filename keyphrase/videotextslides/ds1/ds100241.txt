Row 1::Height 2::beyond experimental studies
Row 2::Height 1::we will develop a general methodology for
Row 3::Height 3::analyzing running time of algorithms this
Row 4::Height 1::approach
Row 5::Height 3::uses high level description of the algorithm
Row 6::Height 1::instead of testing one of its implementations
Row 7::Height 1::takes into account all possible inputs
Row 8::Height 1::allows one to evaluate the efficiency any
Row 9::Height 3::algorithm in way that is independent of the
Row 10::Height 1::hardware and software environment
