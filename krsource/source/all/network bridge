Network bridging describes the action taken by network equipment to allow two or more communication networks, or two or more network segments,[1] to create an aggregate network. Bridging is distinct from routing which allows the networks to communicate independently as separate networks.[2] A network bridge is a network device that connects more than one network segment. In the OSI model bridging acts in the first two layers.[citation needed]
There are four types of network-bridging technologies: simple bridging; multiport bridging; learning, or transparent bridging; and source route bridging.[3][4] Transparent bridging was originally developed by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the 1980s.[5]
