Look up view in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.


A view is what can be seen in a range of vision. View may also be used as a synonym of point of view in the first sense. View may also be used figuratively or with special significancefor example, to imply a scenic outlook or significant vantage point:

The barrier Rhine hath flashed, through battle-smoke,
On men who gaze heart-smitten by the view,
As if all Germany had felt the shock!




- from The Germans on the Heights of Hochheim (1816) by William Wordsworth



[edit] Law
Laws or regulations in various jurisdictions may protect a view as an easement, preventing property owners from constructing buildings that would block the view from another location. For example, planning regulations in London protect the view of various historical buildings, such as St. Paul's Cathedral and the Palace of Westminster.
