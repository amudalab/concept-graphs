A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most popular databases currently in use are based on the relational database model.
[edit] History
In 1974, IBM began developing System R, a research project to develop a prototype RDBMS.[1] Its first commercial product was SQL/DS, released in 1981.[2] However, the first commercially available RDBMS was Oracle, released in 1979 by Relational Software, now Oracle Corporation.[3]
