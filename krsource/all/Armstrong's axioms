Armstrong's axioms are a set of axioms (or, more precisely, inference rules) used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database. They were developed by William W. Armstrong on his 1974 paper.[1] The axioms are sound in that they generate only functional dependencies in the closure of a set of functional dependencies (denoted as F+) when applied to that set (denoted as ). They are also complete in that repeated application of these rules will generate all functional dependencies in the closure .
More formally, let <(), > denote a relational scheme over the set of attributes  with a set of functional dependencies . We say that a functional dependency  is logically implied by ,and denote it with  if and only if for every instance  of  that satisfies the functional dependencies in , r also satisfies . We denote by  the set of all functional dependencies that are logically implied by .
Furthermore, with respect to a set of inference rules , we say that a functional dependency  is derivable from the functional dependencies in  by the set of inference rules , and we denote it by  if and only if  is obtainable by means of repeatedly applying the inference rules in  to functional dependencies in . We denote by  the set of all functional dependencies that are derivable from  by inference rules in .
Then, a set of inference rules  is sound if and only if the following holds:

that is to say, we cannot derive by means of  functional dependencies that are not logically implied by . The set of inference rules  is said to be complete if the following holds:

more simply put, we are able to derive by  all the functional dependencies that are logically implied by .

[edit] Axioms
Let () be a relation scheme over the set of attributes . Henceforth we will denote by letters , ,  any subset of  and, for short, the union of two sets of attributes  and  by  instead of the usual ; this notation is rather standard in database theory when dealing with sets of attributes.

[edit] Armstrong relation
Given a set of functional dependencies , the Armstrong relation is a relation which satisfies all the functional dependencies in the closure  and only those dependencies. Unfortunately, the minimum-size Armstrong relation for a given set of dependencies can have a size which is an exponential function of the number of attributes in the dependencies considered.[2]
