Not to be confused with Dictionary (data structure).
A data dictionary, or metadata repository, as defined in the IBM Dictionary of Computing, is a "centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format."[1] The term may have one of several closely related meanings pertaining to databases and database management systems (DBMS):

a document describing a database or collection of databases
an integral component of a DBMS that is required to determine its structure
a piece of middleware that extends or supplants the native data dictionary of a DBMS

[edit] Documentation
The term Data Dictionary and Data Repository are used to indicate a more general software utility than a catalogue. A Catalogue is closely coupled with the DBMS Software; it provides the information stored in it to user and the DBA, but it is mainly accessed by the various software modules of the DBMS itself, such as DDL and DML compilers, the query optimiser, the transaction processor, report generators, and the constraint enforcer. On the other hand, a Data Dictionary is a data structure that stores meta-data, i.e., data about data. The Software package for a stand-alone Data Dictionary or Data Repository may interact with the software modules of the DBMS, but it is mainly used by the Designers, Users and Administrators of a computer system for information resource management. These systems are used to maintain information on system hardware and software configuration, documentation, application and users as well as other information relevant to system administration.
If a data dictionary system is used only by the designers, users, and administrators and not by the DBMS Software, it is called a Passive Data Dictionary; otherwise, it is called an Active Data Dictionary or Data Dictionary. An Active Data Dictionary is automatically updated as changes occur in the database. A Passive Data Dictionary must be manually updated.
The data Dictionary consists of record types (tables) created in the database by systems generated command files, tailored for each supported back-end DBMS. Command files contain SQL Statements for CREATE TABLE, CREATE UNIQUE INDEX, ALTER TABLE (for referential integrity), etc., using the specific statement required by that type of database.
Database users and application developers can benefit from an authoritative data dictionary document that catalogs the organization, contents, and conventions of one or more databases.[2] This typically includes the names and descriptions of various tables and fields in each database, plus additional details, like the type and length of each data element. There is no universal standard as to the level of detail in such a document, but it is primarily a weak kind of data.
[edit] Middleware
In the construction of database applications, it can be useful to introduce an additional layer of data dictionary software, i.e. middleware, which communicates with the underlying DBMS data dictionary. Such a "high-level" data dictionary may offer additional features and a degree of flexibility that goes beyond the limitations of the native "low-level" data dictionary, whose primary purpose is to support the basic functions of the DBMS, not the requirements of a typical application. For example, a high-level data dictionary can provide alternative entity-relationship models tailored to suit different applications that share a common database.[3] Extensions to the data dictionary also can assist in query optimization against distributed databases.[4]
Software frameworks aimed at rapid application development sometimes include high-level data dictionary facilities, which can substantially reduce the amount of programming required to build menus, forms, reports, and other components of a database application, including the database itself. For example, PHPLens includes a PHP class library to automate the creation of tables, indexes, and foreign key constraints portably for multiple databases.[5] Another PHP-based data dictionary, part of the RADICORE toolkit, automatically generates program objects, scripts, and SQL code for menus and forms with data validation and complex joins.[6] For the ASP.NET environment, Base One's data dictionary provides cross-DBMS facilities for automated database creation, data validation, performance enhancement (caching and index utilization), application security, and extended data types.[7] Visual DataFlex features[8] provides the ability to use DataDictionaries as class files to form middle layer between the user interface and the underlying database. The intent is to create standardized rules to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules throughout one or more related applications.
