In computer science, hash trie can refer to:

A space-efficient implementation of a sparse trie, in which the descendants of each node may be interleaved in memory. (The name is suggested by a similarity to a closed hash table.) [1][verification needed]
An ordinary trie used to store hash values, for example, in an implementation of a hash tree.
A data structure which "combines features of hash tables and LC-tries in order to perform efficient lookups and updates" [2]
