The B-trie is a trie-based data structure that can store and retrieve variable-length strings efficiently on disk.[1]
The B-trie was compared against several high-performance variants of B-tree that were designed for string keys. It was shown to offer superior performance, particularly under skew access (i.e., many repeated searches). It is currently a leading choice for maintaining a string dictionary on disk, along with other disk-based tasks, such as maintaining an index to a string database or for accumulating the vocabulary of a large text collection.
