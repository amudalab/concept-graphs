The relative velocity  (also  or ) is the velocity of an object or observer B in the rest frame of another object or observer A. If it is constant,



where  is A's velocity in the rest frame of B.

[edit] Classical mechanics




Relative velocities between two particles in classical mechanics.


In the Newtonian limit where approximately the Galilean transformation




holds, it is identical with the vector difference between the velocities of A and B, as evaluated in terms of a single coordinate system:

.

Due to Einstein's Special Relativity (SR), doesn't hold in general. The expression "the velocity of A relative to B" is shorthand for "the velocity of A in the coordinate system where B is always at rest".
[edit] Special relativity theory
According to SR, the vacuum speed of light is isotropically equal to a universal constant c in any coordinate systems. Inter alia, it leads to the fact that

apart from Newtonian limit, velocities are not additive quantities, and
the difference velocity between A and B is not equal to their relative velocity and particularly has a smaller absolute value. Whereas the maximum difference speed between two objects is 2c, the maximum absolute value of a relative velocity is equal to c.

To get  from  and  in an arbitrary reference frame, it's necessary to Lorentz transformation the latter into the rest frame of A. If  and  are collinear, the formula



holds.
[edit] Example
Joe and Sara are driving in the same direction. Joes velocity is 90 km/h and Saras 100 km/h. If we take Joes velocity as  and Saras  then



This is the velocity observed by Joe. Joe sees Sara moving at 10 km/h.
