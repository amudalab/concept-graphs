Telecommunications equipment (also telecoms equipment or communications equipment) is hardware used for the purposes of telecommunications.
Since the 1990s the boundary between telecoms equipment and IT hardware has become blurred as a result of the growth of the internet and its increasing role in the transfer of telecoms data.[1][2]

[edit] Vendors
The world's five largest telecommunications equipment (ex. mobile phone handsets) vendors measured by applicable 2011 revenues are:[4]

 Ericsson
 Huawei
 Alcatel-Lucent
/ Nokia Siemens Networks
 ZTE

The world's five largest router and switch vendors measured by applicable revenues in the first quarter of 2012 are:[5]

 Cisco Systems
 Alcatel-Lucent
 Huawei
 Juniper Networks
 ZTE

The world's 10 largest mobile phone handset vendors measured by unit sales in the second quarter of 2012 are (global market share shown in parentheses):[6]

 Samsung (21.6%)
 Nokia (19.9%)
 Apple (6.9%)
 ZTE (4.3%)
 LG Electronics (3.4%)
 Huawei (2.6%)
 TCL (2.2%)
 HTC (2.2%)
 Motorola Mobility (2.2%)
 Research In Motion (1.9%)

As of 2012 many of the largest telecoms networking equipment vendors are struggling financially due to over supply, rising market share of China-based vendors, and declining revenues for 2G and 3G networks not being fully offset by the growing market for 4G equipment.[7][8]
