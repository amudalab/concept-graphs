A zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZSDD or ZDD) is a type of binary decision diagram (BDD) where instead of nodes being introduced when the positive and the negative part are different, they are introduced when negative part is different from constant 0. A Zero-suppressed decision diagram is also commonly referred to as a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZBDD).
They are useful when dealing with functions that are almost everywhere 0.
