In computer science, a 23 heap is a data structure, a variation on the heap, designed by Tadao Takaoka in 1999. The structure is similar to the Fibonacci heap, and borrows from the 23 tree.
Time costs for some common heap operations are:

Delete-min takes  amortized time.
Decrease-key takes constant amortized time.
Insertion takes constant amortized time.
